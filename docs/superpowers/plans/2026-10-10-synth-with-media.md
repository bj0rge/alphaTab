# Synthesizer + backing track / external media mixing — Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or
> superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** When a song plays from a backing track or external media, alphaTab also runs its synthesizer (metronome,
count-in, optionally the tracks) locked to the media: within p95 ≤ 3 ms at 1×, ≤ 5 ms at 1.25×/1.5×, and within
the media's own time-stretch wobble (p95 ≤ 20 ms) at 0.5×/0.75×, with no cost when the feature is off.

**Architecture:** The media stays the clock. The worker synth renders on the media's time axis (sync points map
media time to song time) and tags every sample chunk with its media time. The AudioWorklet reports "at context
frame F I output media time T" about 20 times a second. A pure `MediaSyncController` compares that with the media
clock and nudges the synth's rate (±2 %), re-syncs above a threshold, and plans the start, seek, count-in and loop
handshakes. `MediaSynthPlayer` is one `IAlphaSynth` over the two players and owns the transport state and the loop
wrap.

**Tech Stack:** TypeScript (alphaTab 1.9.0 alpha, `develop` @ `25ef76d3`), Web Workers, Web Audio (AudioWorklet,
`createMediaElementSource`, `DynamicsCompressorNode`), vitest (Node), Biome, the alphaTab playground (Vite).

**Spec:** [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-07-synth-with-media-design.md`](../specs/2026-10-07-synth-with-media-design.md)
@ `97afd3ab` (its review closed after lap 2 at `f3aff5b4`; this plan's review amended it after that; its §14 open
items are settled by this plan). Section numbers below (§4, §6.2, …) are the spec's. Spike evidence: [`docs/spikes/issue-2397/`](../../spikes/issue-2397/).

---

## How to run this plan

- **Execution method (chosen 2026-10-10):** subagent-driven (superpowers:subagent-driven-development). A fresh
  implementer and a fresh reviewer per task, then a whole-branch review. The main session runs the decision gates.
  Implementation starts only after the plan review (spec-triage-loop:doc-review-loop) is done.
- **Branch.** Task 1 creates `feat/2397-synth-with-media` from `25ef76d3` (the spec's base, where every line
  reference in this plan holds) in its own worktree, and carries `docs/superpowers/` and
  `docs/spikes/issue-2397/` from `spike/2397-sync-options` so the spec, this plan and the evidence travel with the
  code. Those doc commits are dropped if an upstream PR is ever prepared (§11 step 5). The spike branch stays as a
  reference; its `MixSpikePlayer` and `_spike*` code is never copied (§4: "written fresh, with tests").
- **Each task ends green and pushed.** Run the gates named in the task, commit, `git push`. Never
  `git commit --no-verify` / `git push --no-verify`. Never a bare `git stash` (the stash is shared across
  worktrees). Tracked files never contain absolute home-directory paths: use repo-relative paths.
- **Decision gates (D-1 … D-10)** are marked **STOP — decision gate**. The main session runs them, never a task
  subagent: run the measurement named in the gate first, then put the choice to the person as an
  `AskUserQuestion` picker tagged `[Q-D<n>]`, following `spec-triage-loop:triage` (load it before the first picker):
  scenario first, the app it affects, High / Medium / Low confidence per option, whether each option was spiked.
  The plan already implements the recommended option, so the gate either confirms it or switches to the
  alternative it names. `[No preference]` or "Skip — decide later" means *not decided*: keep the implemented
  default, carry the item, never pick for the person.
- **Today's synth bugs are out of scope.** Where a task meets one (each is named where it appears), leave it as it
  is: no fix in this work.
- **Repo gates** (§9): from the repository root, `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`. When the
  playground changes, also `npm run typecheck --workspace=packages/playground`.
- **Sync lab:** `npm run dev --workspace=packages/playground -- --port 5188 --strictPort`, then
  `http://localhost:5188/demos/sync-lab/` (Task 21 creates it). Save every new measurement in
  `docs/spikes/issue-2397/` (a dated `.md` plus raw numbers in a dated `results-*.json`).

## Global Constraints

Copied from the spec; every task's requirements include these.

- Base: `develop` @ `25ef76d3` (alphaTab 1.9.0 alpha); consumers upgrade (§2 Base).
- Switch: `player.enableSynthesizerWithMedia: boolean = false` (§2, §7).
- Public additions: `player.mediaSyncOffsetInMilliseconds: number = 0` (+ = synth plays later); runtime
  `api.backingTrackVolume = 1` and `api.synthVolume = 1` (D-6: `synthVolume` stays public). New settings and API
  members get doc comments in the repo's style and `@since 1.9.0`; `PlayerSettings` changes need
  `npm run generate-typescript` (§7).
- Mixing requires `PlayerOutputMode.WebAudioAudioWorklets` (the default) and working AudioWorklets (an
  `AudioWorkletNode` and a secure context). Otherwise: media only, plus a warning (§2 Output mode, §7 Wiring).
- Setting off: identical object graph to today, no synth worker or AudioWorklet created, no extra main-thread work
  (S7, §10).
- Mixing on: no decoded media in memory; CPU and main-thread cost comparable to synth mode (S8, §10).
- Code homes (§2, §3): the synth "follow media" part is shared TypeScript (`synth/`, must stay transpilable to
  C#/Kotlin: no DOM types, no web APIs); the combined player, sync controller, clocks and probe are web-only
  (`platform/javascript/`, tagged `@target web`). `platform/worker/` is shared with C# and Kotlin: their UI facades
  create `AlphaSynthWebWorkerApi` and their thread workers implement `IAlphaSynthWorker`. Task 5's web-only additions
  there are left for an upstream PR (After this plan); this plan's gates don't build C# or Kotlin.
- Not changed (§4): the normal (non-following) synth path, the audio exporter, the media players' cursor logic.
  Non-mixed modes keep today's behavior (§8).
- Delivery (§11): a patch for **both** apps — patch-package in `alphaTabWebsite`, `pnpm patch` in
  `notation-hero/web`. Upstream PR later and optional.
- alphaTab's [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md): no PR without an accepted issue; issues describe problems, not
  solutions; the `alphatab-ai-authored-v1` disclosure on every issue, PR and comment; never post the #2397 comment
  without the person's OK.

## Review Focus

The five inputs the spec implies but no other test pins, most likely to bite first. Each has a test in the task
that owns the code.

1. **A backing track that runs past the score** (an outro after the last bar). The media plays to the song's end (its
   last sync point), not to its own end: there the media player's own end check fires `finished` once and both stop,
   as today, so the outro is not played. The synth doesn't stop by itself at the song's end: what it rendered past it
   stays stamped and silent until that stop. Tests: Task 3 (`keeps-following-after-the-song-ends`) and Task 16
   (`the-song-end-stops-both-once`, with an 18 s outro).
2. **Actions in the middle of a handshake**: Pause while the media start is still delayed, Pause or a seek during
   the count-in, a speed change during the count-in. Expected: no media `play()` after a Pause, no second worklet,
   no `stateChanged` from inside the handshake; after a speed change during the count-in, its last clicks and the
   media's start follow the new speed. Tests: Task 16 (`pause-during-the-media-delay-cancels-the-media-start`),
   Task 17 (`pause-during-the-count-in-cancels-the-hand-off`, `a-seek-during-the-count-in-restarts-without-count-in`,
   `a-speed-change-during-the-count-in-hands-off-at-the-new-speed`, `a-slower-count-in-does-not-hit-the-time-limit`,
   `a-speed-change-during-a-count-in-at-the-song-start-keeps-the-media-at-0`), and on the real synth Task 4
   (`a-seek-during-the-count-in-ends-it`).
3. **Play before the background probe is done, or while the `AudioContext` is still suspended** (autoplay policy).
   Expected: the start uses the straight-line guess, the probe waits for a running context, and a value that
   lands mid-playback settles without cutting notes (D-1). Tests: Task 10 (`latency-change-settles-without-resync`),
   Task 15 (`probe-waits-for-a-running-context`) and Task 16 (`a-probe-value-during-playback-settles`).
4. **Changing `enableSynthesizerWithMedia` or `playerMode` at runtime** through `updateSettings()`. Expected: the
   old player is destroyed, the new one is created, and volumes, speed and looping are restored. Test: Task 20
   (`flag-change-recreates-the-player`, `wrapper-restores-media-volumes`).
5. **`destroy()` while a timer is pending** (a delayed media start, a count-in time limit, a hand-off, a loop
   wrap). Expected: nothing fires into a destroyed player. Tests: Task 16 (`destroy-clears-pending-timers`) and
   Task 18 (`destroy-clears-the-wrap-timer`).

## Where each §14 open item lands

Every item is **our design's problem**: none of them is a bug in today's synth. Confidence is for the
recommendation as it stands. "Spiked" says whether a run backs it.

| Item | App | What the plan does | Task / gate | Test | Spiked? | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| F-9a | both | A speed with no learned value of its own uses a straight-line guess between learned speeds (`PerSpeedValues`). A probe value that lands during playback settles without a forced re-sync. | Tasks 8, 10 · D-1 in Task 22 | unit (spike 11's numbers) · lab: first Play at an unprobed speed, probe value mid-loop | guess: yes (spike 11 §2) · probe part: no | Medium (guess) · Low (probe part) |
| F-9d | both | S12 (new success criterion) plus lab tests for an auto-BPM loop (+5 BPM per wrap), a held sweep in 1-BPM steps, and the first Play at an unprobed speed | Task 21 (lab) · Task 22 (S12 into the spec, run) | lab | sweep: yes (spike 11 §1) | High (the sweep re-syncs at each step) · Medium (rest) |
| F-3 | both | Settle re-sync threshold at 1× = max(12 ms, 2 × `baseLatency` + 1 ms). The lab's first-click tolerance = max(±11 ms, ±2 × `baseLatency`). A run on a machine with `baseLatency` > 5.3 ms. | Task 9 (code) · Task 21 (lab) · Task 23 (run, D-2) | unit + lab | no | Low |
| F-14 | both | Count-in media pre-roll below 1× = 120 ms (the recommendation). D-3 compares 60 ms and 120 ms with the real count-in. The 1.5× figure is restated as 0…+2.7 ms. The first count-in at an unlearned speed is marked (open). | Task 9 (constant) · Task 10 (rule) · Task 22 (D-3, spec edits) | lab count-in test at 0.5× | yes (spike 6, emulated count-in) | Medium |
| Q-1 | both | S4 reports the first Play at a speed with no learned start lead separately and doesn't gate on it; S12 does the same for each auto-BPM repetition (D-4, settled in the plan review) | Task 22 (D-4, settled) | lab start test's first-Play cell | yes (spikes 11 §2, 12) | High |
| F-15 | both | Re-run spike 4's loop test at 0.5×, 1× and 1.5×, listen at each wrap the lab flags (and at every 0.5× wrap), then pick the S10 gate (provisional: a median gate plus an ear check) | Task 22 (D-5) | lab loop test | partly (spike 4) | Medium |
| F-5 | alphaTabWebsite | External media wraps without pausing: the media seeks to the range start, and the synth stays silent until the media shows the jump and its clock has a fit again (three position updates over 100 ms or more). It then restarts at the media's position, past the range start (about 110–160 ms at 1× with the rhythm game's 50 ms updates), so every pass of a YouTube loop plays its first beat without a click. S10 is scoped to the backing track. | Task 19 (code, spec edit) · Task 26 (by ear) | unit (fakes) · by ear | on fakes only | Low |
| F-6 | alphaTabWebsite | A start pressed inside YouTube (the position moved at `play()` or within 100 ms) gets no count-in and no learning. Integrations call `updatePosition()` right before `api.play()`. | Task 11 (clock check) · Task 19 (code, spec §7 edit) · Task 20 (setting docs) | unit | no | Low |
| F-17 | alphaTabWebsite | Stall rule: the same position for ≥ 100 ms silences the synth. Once the position moves, the fit restarts there, and the synth restarts at the media's position when the clock has a fit again (three position updates over 100 ms or more). | Tasks 11, 19 | unit | modeled (spike 9 §4) | Medium |
| F-11 | alphaTabWebsite | Both clocks subtract `mediaSyncOffsetInMilliseconds × speed`. The spec states the sign (+ = synth later) and the unit (ms of real time). | Task 11 (code, spec edit) | unit | no (arithmetic) | High |
| F-13 | both | Limiter: −1 dBFS, ratio 20, knee 0, attack 1 ms, release 100 ms, then a fixed −0.57 dB trim | Task 14 · lab check in Task 22 | unit (node params) + lab (spike 8 script) | yes (spike 8) | High |
| FYI-3 | both | Keeps `synthVolume` public (D-6, settled in the plan review) | Task 13 (D-6, settled) | none needed | n/a | High |
| F-10 | both | Turn the flag on in both apps where Task 24's platform rule allows (`supportsMixing()`). Rhythm game: YouTube player with `controls: 0`, `disablekb: 1` where mixing is on (on iOS and desktop Safari only if Task 25's YouTube start checks passed there); elsewhere YouTube keeps its controls. notation-hero: Metronome, Count-In and the Tracks mixer open over a recording (the score's tracks play; mute them there); it has no external player yet (J-2), so its spec delta keeps that player's controls and F-6 for later. | Tasks 24, 26, 27 | manual, in each app | no | Medium |
| F-18 | both | Acceptance list becomes "S1–S6 (S6: backing track), S4b, S10, S12" after D-3 and D-4 | Task 22 | lab | n/a | High |
| R-1 | both | iPad with the Ring/Silent switch on: is the backing track still heard? Remedy to try: `navigator.audioSession.type = 'playback'`. | Task 24 (D-8) | iPad, manual | no | Low |
| R-2 | both | WebKit may refuse a `play()` that comes a bar after the gesture (the count-in) or after the pre-roll seek (speeds other than 1×). Safety net: a backing-track start that never happens pauses both and warns (Task 17); for external media the synth goes silent until the media moves, with no pause and no warning (Task 19). The real fallback is decided at D-7. | Task 17 (safety net) · Task 24 (D-7) | unit + iPad | no | Low |

### Gaps the plan fills (not in the spec, carried from the spikes)

Each one is flagged where it is used. Keep or drop them during the plan review.

- **G-1** (spike 11 §1): while following, a speed change doesn't rescale and seek the synth. The position is the
  media's, and a speed change doesn't move it. Task 3.
- **G-2** (the spike's controller): stamps are ignored for 200 ms after a re-sync, so stale stamps from before the
  jump can't trigger another one. Task 9.
- **G-3** (spike 4): the loop-wrap timer fires 15 ms of media time before the range end as heard (below 1× the media is heard ahead of the position it reports); if the timer is late, the first media update past the end wraps at once. Task 18.
- **G-4** (spikes 4 and 6): clamps on the learned values — start lead −50…150 ms, media-start latency −50…250 ms,
  re-sync lead 0…100 ms (the last is in the spec). Tasks 9 and 10.
- **G-5** (spike 6): the count-in hand-off timer fires 12 ms early, then waits on the audio clock for at most 30 ms.
  That is how spike 6 got its 0.2–4.8 ms. Task 17.
- **G-6** (spec wording): the external clock stamps each sample with the context time *being heard* (via
  `getOutputTimestamp()`) and is read at frame time `F / sampleRate`. §6.3's "frame time + `outputLatency`" names
  the same moment, so don't add `outputLatency` twice. Task 11. The output limiter (Task 14) delays all it carries
  by a fixed 6 ms look-ahead (Chromium and WebKit). A backing track passes through it with the synth, so that
  cancels; external media doesn't, so there the synth sounds 6 ms later than this model says, and the offset tuned
  by ear (S9) carries it.
- **G-7** (spec wording, §13): the probe's tap is connected to the destination but outputs silence (as in spike 5).
  A node that isn't connected may not be processed. Task 12 fixes the §13 sentence.

## Decision gates

| Gate | Decides | Where | Implemented default |
|---|---|---|---|
| D-1 | F-9a probe part: a probe value that lands mid-playback settles (no forced re-sync) **or** re-syncs as §6.4 says today | Task 22 | settle only |
| D-2 | F-3: keep the `baseLatency`-derived thresholds **or** go back to the fixed 12 ms / ±11 ms | Task 23 | derived |
| D-3 | F-14: count-in pre-roll below 1× = 120 ms **or** 60 ms | Task 22 | 120 ms |
| D-4 | Q-1: S4 gates the first Play at an unlearned speed **or** only reports it | settled in the plan review | report only |
| D-5 | F-15: S10 gate = every wrap ≤ 30 ms **or** median ≤ 30 ms plus an ear check | Task 22 | median + ear |
| D-6 | FYI-3: `synthVolume` stays public **or** is dropped (apps use `backingTrackVolume` + `masterVolume`) | settled in the plan review | public (as §7 says) |
| D-7 | R-2: the fallback when WebKit refuses the delayed `play()` | Task 24 | safety net only |
| D-8 | R-1: whether to set `navigator.audioSession.type = 'playback'` while mixing on iOS | Task 24 | not set |
| D-9 | Speed changes while mixing: keep the media player's seek and one re-sync per step **or** change the media's speed without that seek and let a step settle | Task 22 | keep |
| D-10 | A device class that missed a §1 target or failed the listening check: "off" until it passes **or** "on" with the miss written down | Task 24 | off |

  count-in as one stream; `backingTrackVolume` / `synthVolume`.
- `IAlphaSynth.ts` (modify): `backingTrackVolume`, `synthVolume`.
- `BackingTrackPlayer.ts` (modify): applies `masterVolume × backingTrackVolume`; internal `seekMediaTo`,

## Shared interfaces

The names and types the tasks rely on. A task's implementer sees only their own task; this section is how they

## Phase 0 — Branch

### Task 1: Branch, docs and a green baseline

**Files:** nothing in `packages/`; `docs/superpowers/**` and `docs/spikes/issue-2397/**` come from the spike branch.

**Interfaces:** none.

- [ ] **Step 1: Create the worktree and the branch from the spec's base**

Run from the repository's main checkout:

```bash
git fetch origin
git worktree add .claude/worktrees/feat-2397-synth-with-media -b feat/2397-synth-with-media 25ef76d3
```

Expected: `Preparing worktree (new branch 'feat/2397-synth-with-media')`. Work in that folder from here on.

- [ ] **Step 2: Carry the spec, this plan and the spike evidence**

```bash
git checkout origin/spike/2397-sync-options -- docs/superpowers docs/spikes/issue-2397
git add docs/superpowers docs/spikes/issue-2397
git commit -m "docs: carry the #2397 spec, plan and spike evidence"
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Install and run the gates (baseline)**

```bash
npm install
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

Expected: all pass. Write the test count into the task's commit message or PR notes; later tasks only add tests.

- [ ] **Step 4: Push**

```bash
git push -u origin feat/2397-synth-with-media
```

- [ ] **Step 5 (optional; the main session, with the person and the iPad): a WebKit pre-check**

Before Task 2, a throwaway page answers the WebKit unknowns that shape Tasks 12, 15 and 17: R-2 (a refused delayed
`play()`), the probe's hidden `<audio>` and R-1 (the Silent switch). Keep the page out of the repo and serve it over
HTTPS as Task 24 Step 1 does. In the Web MIDI Browser app on the iPad, each on a fresh load: a tap that calls a
routed `<audio>`'s `play()` 2 s later (a count-in bar); a tap that seeks it and calls `play()` in its `seeked`
event (a start away from 1×); after one tap, a new hidden `Audio()` routed through `createMediaElementSource` and
played with no tap (the probe); a routed `<audio>` at 0.5× (heard, and time-stretched rather than silent?); and,
with the Silent switch on, a routed `<audio>` playing. Write what played in
`docs/spikes/issue-2397/webkit-precheck-<date>.md`, then commit and push it. If a start was refused or the Silent
switch muted the routed `<audio>`, put D-7 or D-8 (Task 24 Steps 3–4) to the person now: a fallback picked here is
written into Tasks 12, 15 and 17 before they are built, and Task 24 confirms it with the lab.

## Phase 1 — The synth follows the media (shared code + worker)

### Task 2: Sequencer — media-time mapping, fill-until and the count-in tempo

**Files:**
- Modify: `packages/alphatab/src/synth/MidiFileSequencer.ts` (new methods after `fillMidiEventQueueToEndTime`;
  `startCountIn` and `generateCountInMidi` at the end of the class)
- Create: `packages/alphatab/test/audio/RecordingAudioSynthesizer.ts`
- Create: `packages/alphatab/test/audio/FollowMedia.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: today's `MidiFileSequencer` (`mainTimePositionFromBackingTrack`, `mainTimePositionToBackingTrack`,
  `mainTickPositionToTimePosition`).
- Produces (used by Tasks 3, 4, 15, 18):
  - `fillMidiEventQueueUntil(midiTime: number): boolean`
  - `mainMidiTimeFromMediaTime(mediaTime: number, mediaDuration: number): number` (song ms at speed 1)
  - `mainTickToMediaTime(tick: number, mediaDuration: number): number`
  - `mainSyncBpmAt(mediaTime: number): number` (0 without sync points)
  - `startCountIn(bpm: number = 0)`
  - test helper `RecordingAudioSynthesizer` with `events: RecordedSynthEvent[]` and `synthesizeCalls: number`

The no-sync-points rule (§4 step 2, spike 9 §1): without sync points the media plays the song at its own tempo, so
the target is the media time itself at any speed. `mainTimePositionFromBackingTrack` returns the media time unscaled
there, and today's cursor multiplies it by the speed. That cursor offset is **today's bug**: out of scope, don't
touch it.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the test helper**

Expected: FAIL — `fillMidiEventQueueUntil is not a function` (and the other new methods).

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement the sequencer methods**

In `packages/alphatab/src/synth/MidiFileSequencer.ts`, add after `fillMidiEventQueueToEndTime`:

Then give the count-in an optional tempo:

```diff

         }

         state.tempoChanges.push(new MidiFileSequencerTempoChange(bpm, 0, 0));
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the tests to see them pass**

Run: `npx vitest run test/audio/FollowMedia.test.ts`
Expected: PASS (7 tests).

- [ ] **Step 6: Run the repo gates and commit**

### Task 3: Synth follow mode — rendering on the media's axis, stamps and the played position

**Files:**
- Create: `packages/alphatab/src/synth/MediaSampleOutput.ts`
- Modify: `packages/alphatab/src/synth/AlphaSynth.ts` (`AlphaSynthBase`: new fields and methods,
  `updatePlaybackSpeed`, `onSampleRequest`, `_onSamplesPlayed`)
- Create: `packages/alphatab/test/audio/FollowTestOutput.ts`
- Modify: `packages/alphatab/test/audio/FollowMedia.test.ts` (new tests)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes (Task 2): `fillMidiEventQueueUntil`, `mainMidiTimeFromMediaTime`.
- Produces (used by Tasks 4, 5, 7):
  - `MediaSampleChunk` / `IMediaSampleOutput` (see "Shared interfaces")
  - on `AlphaSynthBase` (all `@internal`): `mediaSampleOutput`, `isFollowingMedia`, `followMedia(...)`,
    `seekToMediaTime(mediaTime)`, `setRateCorrection(factor)`

What it does (§4): per 64-frame micro buffer the media time advances by `microBufferMs × speed × rateCorrection`;
the sequencer moves to the song time of the micro buffer's end; each chunk carries the media time of its first
frame and the media ms per frame. The synth's own finish and loop handling is off while following: the combined
player owns the song end and the wrap (§6.2). **Gap G-1** (spike 11 §1): a speed change while following doesn't
rescale and seek. Today's `updatePlaybackSpeed` does, and in follow mode that jumped the synth 134–356 ms.

- [ ] **Step 1: Create the shared stamp types**

Create `packages/alphatab/src/synth/MediaSampleOutput.ts`:

```ts
/**
 * The media time of one chunk of samples the synthesizer rendered while following a media clock.
 * @internal
 */

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests to see them fail**

Run: `npx vitest run test/audio/FollowMedia.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL — `synth.followMedia is not a function`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Implement follow mode in `AlphaSynthBase`**

In `packages/alphatab/src/synth/AlphaSynth.ts` add the import and a small class above `AlphaSynthBase`:

```ts
import { MediaSampleChunk, type IMediaSampleOutput } from '@coderline/alphatab/synth/MediaSampleOutput';

/**
 * A chunk sent while following a media clock, for the played position.
 * @internal
 */
class FollowedChunk {
    public frames: number;
    public consumed: number = 0;
    public mediaStart: number;
    public mediaPerFrame: number;

    public constructor(frames: number, mediaStart: number, mediaPerFrame: number) {
        this.frames = frames;
        this.mediaStart = mediaStart;
        this.mediaPerFrame = mediaPerFrame;
    }
}
```

Add the fields and the internal API to `AlphaSynthBase` (next to `_notPlayedSamples`):

```ts
    private _follow: boolean = false;
    private _followMediaDuration: number = 0;
    private _followMediaTime: number = 0;
    private _followRateCorrection: number = 1;
    private _followChunks: Queue<FollowedChunk> = new Queue<FollowedChunk>();
    private _followCountInEnded: boolean = false;

    /**
     * Receives the samples while following a media clock, with their media time (set by the web worker).
     * Without it the samples go to {@link output} without media time.
     * @internal
     */
    public mediaSampleOutput: IMediaSampleOutput | null = null;

    /**
     * Whether the synthesizer renders on a media's time axis ({@link followMedia}).
     * @internal
     */
    public get isFollowingMedia(): boolean {
        return this._follow;
    }

    /**

     * points, and every chunk carries its media time. The own loop and finish handling is off meanwhile.
     * @internal
     */
    public followMedia(enabled: boolean, mediaDuration: number, syncPoints: BackingTrackSyncPoint[]): void {
        this._follow = enabled;
        this._followMediaDuration = mediaDuration;
        this._followRateCorrection = 1;
        this.sequencer.mainUpdateSyncPoints(syncPoints);
    }

    /**
     * Jumps to the given media time: the buffers are reset and the song state (programs, controllers) is
     * processed up to there, as for a seek.
     * @internal
     */
    public seekToMediaTime(mediaTime: number): void {
        if (this.sequencer.isPlayingOneTimeMidi) {
            this._stopOneTimeMidi();
        }
        this._followMediaTime = mediaTime;
        this._followChunks.clear();
        this._followCountInEnded = false;
        this.synthesizer.noteOffAll(true);
        const midiTime = this.sequencer.mainMidiTimeFromMediaTime(mediaTime, this._followMediaDuration);
        this.timePosition = Math.max(0, midiTime) / this.sequencer.playbackSpeed;
        if (!this.sequencer.isPlayingMain) {
            // the timePosition setter resets the output only while the main song plays
            this._notPlayedSamples = 0;
            this.output.resetSamples();
        }
    }

    /**
     * Sets how fast media time advances against the synthesizer's own clock (about 0.98 to 1.02).
     * @internal
     */
    public setRateCorrection(factor: number): void {
        this._followRateCorrection = factor;
    }
```

Change `updatePlaybackSpeed` (G-1):

```diff
     protected updatePlaybackSpeed(value: number) {
         const oldSpeed: number = this.sequencer.playbackSpeed;
         this.sequencer.playbackSpeed = value;
+        if (this._follow) {
+            // the position is the media's, and a speed change doesn't move it (spike 11 §1)
+            return;
+        }
         this.timePosition = this.timePosition * (oldSpeed / value);
     }
```

Branch `onSampleRequest` and add the rendering method:

```diff
     protected onSampleRequest() {
+        if (this._follow && this.state === PlayerState.Playing) {
+            this._onFollowSampleRequest();
+            return;
+        }
         if (
```

```ts

        const isCountIn = this.sequencer.isPlayingCountIn;

        } else {
            this.output.addSamples(samples);
        }
    }
```

Branch `_onSamplesPlayed` and add the played-position method:

```diff
     private _onSamplesPlayed(sampleCount: number): void {
         if (sampleCount === 0) {
             return;
         }

+        }
         const playedMillis: number = (sampleCount / this.synthesizer.outSampleRate) * 1000;
```

```ts
    private _onFollowSamplesPlayed(frameCount: number): void {
        this._notPlayedSamples -= frameCount * SynthConstants.AudioChannels;
        let remaining = frameCount;
        let playedMediaTime = -1;
        while (remaining > 0 && !this._followChunks.isEmpty) {
            const chunk = this._followChunks.peek()!;
            const take = Math.min(remaining, chunk.frames - chunk.consumed);
            chunk.consumed += take;
            remaining -= take;
            if (chunk.mediaStart >= 0) {
                playedMediaTime = chunk.mediaStart + chunk.consumed * chunk.mediaPerFrame;
            }
            if (chunk.consumed >= chunk.frames) {
                this._followChunks.dequeue();
            }
        }
        if (playedMediaTime >= 0) {
            const midiTime = this.sequencer.mainMidiTimeFromMediaTime(playedMediaTime, this._followMediaDuration);
            this.updateTimePosition(Math.max(0, midiTime) / this.sequencer.playbackSpeed, false);
        }
        // no checkForFinish: while following, the combined player owns the song end and the loop wrap (§6.2)
    }
```

### Task 4: Count-in while following

**Files:**
- Modify: `packages/alphatab/src/synth/AlphaSynth.ts` (`play()`, `seekToMediaTime`, new `countInStarted` event)
- Modify: `packages/alphatab/test/audio/FollowMedia.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes (Tasks 2, 3): `mainSyncBpmAt`, `startCountIn(bpm)`, the follow rendering (which already ends the count-in
  in-stream and marks the first song chunk `countInEnd`).
- Produces (used by Task 5): `AlphaSynthBase.countInStarted: IEventEmitterOfT<number>` (the count-in's length in ms of
  real time, fired only while following).

§2 and §4: one bar in the time signature at the start position, at the tempo of the sync point active there (else
the score's tempo), rendered on the synth's own clock and then the song in the same stream. In mixed mode this is
what fixes today's count-in freeze and rewind (§8). Non-mixed modes stay as they are; their fix is separate work:
CoderLine/alphaTab#2932 (open), which guards this same `if` with `supportsCountIn` and adds that getter after
`countInVolume`. This edit merges with it cleanly; Task 13's members, also added after `countInVolume`, need a
one-hunk resolution (keep both) if #2932 lands first (Task 26 Step 4).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

Add to the `FollowMediaSynthTests` describe in `FollowMedia.test.ts`:

        expect(lengths.length).toBe(0);
    });
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the tests to see them fail**

Run: `npx vitest run test/audio/FollowMedia.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL — `countInStarted` is undefined.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

In `AlphaSynthBase` add the event (next to `midiEventsPlayed`):

```ts
    /**
     * Fired when a count-in starts while following a media clock, with its length in milliseconds of real time.
     * @internal
     */
    public readonly countInStarted: IEventEmitterOfT<number> = new EventEmitterOfT<number>();
```

and change the count-in start in `play()`:

```diff
         if (this._countInVolume > 0) {
             Logger.debug('AlphaSynth', 'Starting countin');
-            this.sequencer.startCountIn();
+            // following a media clock: the count-in plays at the media's tempo at the start position (§2)
+            this.sequencer.startCountIn(this._follow ? this.sequencer.mainSyncBpmAt(this._followMediaTime) : 0);
             this.synthesizer.setupMetronomeChannel(this.sequencer.metronomeChannel, this._countInVolume);
             this.updateTimePosition(0, true);
+            if (this._follow) {
+                (this.countInStarted as EventEmitterOfT<number>).trigger(this.sequencer.currentEndTime);
+            }
         }
```

and end a running count-in in `seekToMediaTime`, next to the one-time MIDI. The combined player pauses mid
count-in (a seek, Pause or Stop during it) and seeks before it plays again. The end must come before the seek:
while a count-in plays, the `timePosition` setter only moves the song's time without processing its events, and
the skipped notes would then all fire at once.

```diff
         if (this.sequencer.isPlayingOneTimeMidi) {
             this._stopOneTimeMidi();
         }
+        if (this.sequencer.isPlayingCountIn) {
+            // the combined player paused mid count-in (a seek, Pause or Stop): end the count-in before the seek,
+            // as the in-stream end does, so the seek processes the song's events and plays no stale count-in
+            this.sequencer.resetCountIn();
+            this.synthesizer.setupMetronomeChannel(this.sequencer.metronomeChannel, this.metronomeVolume);
+        }
         this._followMediaTime = mediaTime;
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests to see them pass**

Run: `npx vitest run test/audio/FollowMedia.test.ts`
Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the repo gates and commit**

```bash
npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm test
git add packages/alphatab/src/synth/AlphaSynth.ts packages/alphatab/test/audio/FollowMedia.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(synth): count-in at the media's tempo in one stream while following (#2397)"

### Task 5: Worker protocol and the worker's failure signal

**Files:**
- Create: `packages/alphatab/src/platform/javascript/MediaSynthTypes.ts`
- Modify: `packages/alphatab/src/platform/worker/AlphaTabWorkerProtocol.ts`
- Modify: `packages/alphatab/src/platform/worker/AlphaSynthWorkerSynthOutput.ts`
- Modify: `packages/alphatab/src/platform/worker/AlphaSynthWebWorker.ts`
- Modify: `packages/alphatab/src/platform/worker/AlphaSynthWebWorkerApi.ts`
- Create: `packages/alphatab/test/audio/MediaWorkerProtocol.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes (Tasks 3, 4): `followMedia`, `seekToMediaTime`, `setRateCorrection`, `mediaSampleOutput`,
  `countInStarted`, `MediaSampleChunk`.
- Produces (used by Tasks 7, 15–20): `MediaSynthTypes.ts` (all of "Shared interfaces" for the web side);
  `AlphaSynthWebWorkerApi` implements `IMediaSynth` and has
  `mediaSampleOutput: IMediaSampleOutput | null` (set by `BrowserUiFacade` when mixing).

§5: new main → worker messages `alphaSynth.followMedia`, `alphaSynth.seekToMediaTime`, `alphaSynth.setRateCorrection`;
`alphaSynth.output.addSamples` gets `mediaStart?`, `mediaPerFrame?`, `countInEnd?`, `countInFramesLeft?`; worker → main
`alphaSynth.countInStarted`; worklet → main `alphaSynth.output.mediaTimestamp` and `alphaSynth.output.countInEnd`
(Task 7 sends them); main → worklet `alphaSynth.output.hold` / `alphaSynth.output.resume` (keep-alive, Task 7).
F-8 (spike 10 §1): a worker whose script fails to load reports nothing today, because only `message` is listened to.
The new `error` listener raises `workerFailed`. Only the combined player acts on it, so synth-only mode keeps today's
behavior.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run the tests to see them fail**

Run: `npx vitest run test/audio/MediaWorkerProtocol.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL (typecheck errors on the new message shapes, missing `followMedia`, `workerFailed`).

- [ ] **Step 4: Extend the protocol**

In `packages/alphatab/src/platform/worker/AlphaTabWorkerProtocol.ts` (it already imports `BackingTrackSyncPoint`)
extend the union and the worker interface:

```diff
     | { cmd: 'alphaSynth.applyTranspositionPitches'; transpositionPitches: Map<number, number> }
+    | {
+          cmd: 'alphaSynth.followMedia';

+      }

+          mediaStart?: number;

```

```diff

+     */
+    addEventListener(event: 'error', handler: (ev: ErrorEvent) => void): void;
+}
```

(If Biome's `noEmptyInterface` was the reason for `{}` before, this change removes the empty body anyway.)

- [ ] **Step 5: Worker side**

`AlphaSynthWorkerSynthOutput.ts` — implement the stamped samples:

```diff
-export class AlphaSynthWorkerSynthOutput implements ISynthOutput {
+export class AlphaSynthWorkerSynthOutput implements ISynthOutput, IMediaSampleOutput {
@@
+    public addMediaSamples(samples: Float32Array, chunk: MediaSampleChunk): void {
+        this._main.postMessage({
+            cmd: 'alphaSynth.output.addSamples',
+            samples: Environment.prepareForPostMessage(samples),
+            mediaStart: chunk.mediaStart,
+            mediaPerFrame: chunk.mediaPerFrame,
+            countInEnd: chunk.countInEnd,
+            countInFramesLeft: chunk.countInFramesLeft
+        });
+    }
```

(with `import type { IMediaSampleOutput, MediaSampleChunk } from '@coderline/alphatab/synth/MediaSampleOutput';`)

`AlphaSynthWebWorker.ts` — keep the output, wire the event and the new commands:

```diff
             case 'alphaSynth.initialize':

                 Logger.logLevel = data.logLevel;

                 this._main.postMessage({
                     cmd: 'alphaSynth.ready'
                 });
 
                 break;

+                this._player.setRateCorrection(data.factor);
+                break;
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Main side**

`AlphaSynthWebWorkerApi.ts`:

```diff
-export class AlphaSynthWebWorkerApi implements IAlphaSynth {
+export class AlphaSynthWebWorkerApi implements IMediaSynth {
     private _synth!: IAlphaSynthWorker;
     private _output: ISynthOutput;
+
+    /**
+     * Receives the stamped samples while mixing with media (the AudioWorklet output); set by BrowserUiFacade.
+     * Without it stamped samples go to the output like any other samples.
+     * @internal
+     */
+    public mediaSampleOutput: IMediaSampleOutput | null = null;
```

In the constructor, after the `message` listener:

```diff
         this._synth.addEventListener('message', e => this.handleWorkerMessage(e));
+        // F-8 (spike 10 §1): a worker whose script fails to load only fires 'error'
+        this._synth.addEventListener('error', e => this._onWorkerError(e));
```

New members:

```ts
    public followMedia(enabled: boolean, mediaDuration: number, syncPoints: BackingTrackSyncPoint[]): void {
        this._synth.postMessage({
            cmd: 'alphaSynth.followMedia',
            enabled,
            mediaDuration,
            syncPoints: Environment.prepareForPostMessage(syncPoints)
        });
    }

    public seekToMediaTime(mediaTime: number): void {
        this._synth.postMessage({ cmd: 'alphaSynth.seekToMediaTime', mediaTime });
    }

    public setRateCorrection(factor: number): void {
        this._synth.postMessage({ cmd: 'alphaSynth.setRateCorrection', factor });
    }

    private _onWorkerError(e: ErrorEvent): void {
        // only the combined player acts on this; synth-only mode keeps today's behavior
        (this.workerFailed as EventEmitterOfT<Error>).trigger(
            new Error(`The alphaSynth worker failed: ${e.message ?? 'unknown error'}`)
        );
    }

    readonly countInStarted: IEventEmitterOfT<number> = new EventEmitterOfT<number>();
    readonly workerFailed: IEventEmitterOfT<Error> = new EventEmitterOfT<Error>();
```

In `handleWorkerMessage`:

```diff
-            case 'alphaSynth.output.addSamples':
-                this._output.addSamples(data.samples);
-                break;
+            case 'alphaSynth.output.addSamples': {
+                const mediaOutput = this.mediaSampleOutput;
+                if (mediaOutput && data.mediaStart !== undefined) {
+                    const chunk = new MediaSampleChunk();
+                    chunk.mediaStart = data.mediaStart;
+                    chunk.mediaPerFrame = data.mediaPerFrame ?? 0;
+                    chunk.countInEnd = data.countInEnd === true;
+                    chunk.countInFramesLeft = data.countInFramesLeft ?? -1;
+                    mediaOutput.addMediaSamples(data.samples, chunk);
+                } else {
+                    this._output.addSamples(data.samples);
+                }
+                break;
+            }
+            case 'alphaSynth.countInStarted':
+                (this.countInStarted as EventEmitterOfT<number>).trigger(data.lengthMs);
+                break;
```

Imports: `MediaSampleChunk, type IMediaSampleOutput` from `@coderline/alphatab/synth/MediaSampleOutput`;
`type IMediaSynth` from `@coderline/alphatab/platform/javascript/MediaSynthTypes`. `IAlphaSynth` is no longer used
here: change its import to `import type { BackingTrackSyncPoint } from '@coderline/alphatab/synth/IAlphaSynth';`.

- [ ] **Step 7: Run the tests to see them pass**

Run: `npx vitest run test/audio/MediaWorkerProtocol.test.ts`
Expected: PASS (6 tests). If `toEqual` on the posted `syncPoints` fails because `prepareForPostMessage` returns a
copy in Node, compare `cmd`, `enabled` and `mediaDuration` field by field instead.

- [ ] **Step 8: Run the repo gates and commit**

```bash
npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm test
git add packages/alphatab/src/platform packages/alphatab/test/audio/MediaWorkerProtocol.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(worker): protocol for following a media clock; report a failing synth worker (#2397)"
git push
```

## Phase 2 — AudioWorklet output

### Task 6: Chunk markers (pure)

**Files:**
- Create: `packages/alphatab/src/platform/javascript/MediaChunkMarkers.ts`
- Create: `packages/alphatab/test/audio/MediaChunkMarkers.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing.
- Produces (used by Task 7's processor): `MediaChunkMarkers` with
  `push(frames, mediaStart, mediaPerFrame, countInEnd, countInFramesLeft = -1)`, `mediaTimeAtReadPosition(): number`
  (−1 = not stamped), `consume(frames): boolean` (true = every consumed frame was stamped),
  `framesUntilCountInEnd(): number` (exact once the chunk after the count-in is buffered, else from the latest
  count-in chunk's frames left; −1 = neither buffered), `bufferedFrames`, `clear()`.

§5: one marker per **written** chunk, stamped or not, so the markers stay aligned with the circular buffer. (The
spike's version only kept stamped chunks, which drifts out of line as soon as the unstamped count-in samples sit in
the buffer.)

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

### Task 7: Worklet — stamps, count-in end, keep-alive, request accounting, failure event

**Files:**
- Modify: `packages/alphatab/src/platform/javascript/AlphaSynthAudioWorkletOutput.ts` (the processor in
  `AlphaSynthWebWorklet.init()` and the `AlphaSynthAudioWorkletOutput` class)
- Create: `packages/alphatab/test/audio/AudioWorkletOutputMedia.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `MediaChunkMarkers` (Task 6); `MediaSampleChunk` (Task 3); `MediaTimestampEventArgs`,
  `IMediaFollowingOutput` (Task 5); the protocol messages (Task 5).
- Produces (used by Tasks 15–20): `AlphaSynthAudioWorkletOutput implements IMediaFollowingOutput`, plus
  `audioContext: AudioContext | null` (internal getter).

§5's three AudioWorklet changes, plus F-8's failure event:

| Change | Why |
|---|---|
| Chunk markers record written frames; a `mediaTimestamp` about every 50 ms, only when the block came entirely from stamped chunks; `countInEnd` from the first count-in chunk written (each carries the frames left until the count-in ends), refined every ~50 ms until the boundary is read | exact "media time at `currentFrame`"; the media start is planned a bar ahead: the ring buffer holds ~213 ms at the default 500 ms `bufferTimeInMilliseconds`, less than the 240 ms lead the 0.5× pre-roll needs |
| Keep-alive (mixing only): `hold` = silent, no requests, buffer and markers cleared, incoming samples dropped; `resume`; `warmUp()` creates the node early | rebuilding the worklet on every Play made the first click 100–117 ms late (spike finding F7) |
| `requestedBufferCount` never below 0, **all modes** | a negative count made the worklet over-request forever: overflow dropped, the synth ran ~1.8× fast (finding F8) |
| `workletFailed` when a worklet operation fails (module load, node creation) | spike 10 §2: today the app hears nothing, the player shows Playing and nothing moves |

`currentFrame` in the AudioWorklet scope: inside `process()` it is the first frame of the block being rendered;
between blocks (in a message handler) it is the first frame of the next block. That is why the count-in end's
base frame differs between the two call sites below.

Today's output reports ready before its worklet loads (spike 10 §2). That is **today's bug**: out of scope, don't
change it. The new `workletFailed` event is only acted on by the combined player.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

Create `packages/alphatab/test/audio/AudioWorkletOutputMedia.test.ts`:

```ts
/**
 * The AudioWorklet output while mixing with media: keep-alive, destination, stamps, failures (spec §5).
 * Web Audio is faked: these tests check the output's own logic, the sync lab checks the real audio.
 * @target web

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the tests to see them fail**

Run: `npx vitest run test/audio/AudioWorkletOutputMedia.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL — `keepAlive`, `warmUp`, `mediaTimestamp`, `workletFailed` don't exist.

- [ ] **Step 3: The processor**

In `AlphaSynthWebWorklet.init()` (top of `AlphaSynthAudioWorkletOutput.ts`), declare the scope global next to
`sampleRate`:

```ts
/**
 * @target web
 * @internal
 */
declare let currentFrame: number;
```

Import `MediaChunkMarkers` at the top of the file. In the processor class add the fields:

```diff
                 private _requestedBufferCount: number = 0;
                 private _isStopped = false;
+                private _markers: MediaChunkMarkers = new MediaChunkMarkers();
+                private _framesSinceReport: number = 0;
+                private _isHeld: boolean = false;
```

Replace the processor's `_handleMessage`:

```ts
                private _handleMessage(e: MessageEvent<IAlphaSynthWorkerMessage>) {
                    const data = e.data;
                    const cmd = data.cmd;
                    switch (cmd) {
                        case 'alphaSynth.output.addSamples': {
                            // never below 0: a negative count over-requests forever, the overflow is dropped
                            // and the synth runs fast (spike finding F8)
                            this._requestedBufferCount = Math.max(0, this._requestedBufferCount - 1);
                            if (this._isHeld) {
                                break;
                            }
                            const f: Float32Array = data.samples;
                            const written = this._circularBuffer.write(f, 0, f.length);
                            this._markers.push(
                                written / SynthConstants.AudioChannels,
                                data.mediaStart ?? -1,
                                data.mediaPerFrame ?? 0,
                                data.countInEnd === true,
                                data.countInFramesLeft ?? -1
                            );
                            if (data.countInEnd === true || (data.countInFramesLeft ?? -1) >= 0) {
                                // a count-in chunk already tells where the count-in ends, about a bar ahead;
                                // between blocks currentFrame is the next block's first frame
                                this._reportCountInEnd(currentFrame);
                            }
                            break;
                        }
                        case 'alphaSynth.output.resetSamples':
                            this._circularBuffer.clear();
                            this._markers.clear();
                            break;
                        case 'alphaSynth.output.stop':
                            this._isStopped = true;
                            break;
                        case 'alphaSynth.output.hold':
                            // kept alive while paused (mixing mode): silent, no requests
                            this._isHeld = true;
                            this._circularBuffer.clear();
                            this._markers.clear();
                            break;
                        case 'alphaSynth.output.resume':
                            this._isHeld = false;
                            break;
                    }
                }
```

In `process()`, after the `if (!left || !right)` check, hold:

```ts
                    if (this._isHeld) {
                        left.fill(0);
                        right.fill(0);
                        return true;
                    }
```

and around the buffer read:

```diff

`pause()` and `destroy()`:

`_enqueue` raises the failure:

```diff

         this._operations = this._operations.then(operation).catch(e => {
             Logger.error('WebAudio', `Audio Worklet operation failed: reason=${e}`);

         });
     }
```

`_start` resumes a kept node instead of building a second one, and connects to the destination node:

```ts

        let worklet = this._worklet;

## Phase 3 — Sync logic (pure, web)

### Task 8: `PerSpeedValues` — the straight-line guess (F-9a)

**Files:**
- Create: `packages/alphatab/src/platform/javascript/PerSpeedValues.ts`
- Create: `packages/alphatab/test/audio/PerSpeedValues.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces (used by Tasks 9–12, 15): `PerSpeedValues` with `get(speed)`, `set(speed, value)`, `has(speed)`,
  `delete(speed)`, `size`, `toRecord()`, static `key(speed)`.

F-9a (both apps; our design's problem; spiked: spike 11 §2; confidence Medium): a speed with no value of its own
(no learned start lead, media-start latency or probe value yet) uses a straight line between the nearest speeds that
have one. Spike 11: the first start re-synced in 0 of 6 starts with the guess, against 5 of 6 with 0.

### Task 9: `MediaSyncController` — readings, nudge, re-sync, thresholds (F-3)

**Files:**
- Create: `packages/alphatab/src/platform/javascript/MediaSyncController.ts`
- Create: `packages/alphatab/test/audio/MediaSyncController.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `PerSpeedValues` (Task 8).
- Produces (used by Tasks 10, 15–19): `MediaSyncConstants`, `IMediaSyncSynth`, `IMediaSyncClock`, `IMediaSyncTime`,
  `MediaSyncStats` (`resyncTimes`, `driftLog`, `resyncLeadMs`), `MediaSyncDriftEntry`, `MediaSyncController` with
  `startedAfterHandOff(speed, learnMediaStartLatency)`, `stopped()`, `resync()`, `speedChanged(speed)`,
  `latencyChanged()`, `onStamp(frame, synthMediaTime)`, `settleThreshold(speed)`, `baseLatencyMs`, `speed`,
  `correction`, `isActive`, `isSettling`, `startLeads`, `mediaStartLatencies`; `MediaSyncLearnedValues` (where the
  learned start values live: one set per media kind for the page session).

The rules (§6.2): re-syncs, and the learning of the re-sync lead and the media-start latency, act only on two
consecutive readings that agree within 3 ms (their mean). The nudge's EMA takes each reading itself: while settling
only a reading that agrees with the one before it, once locked every reading. Settle for 1.5 s after a play, seek or
speed change. Re-sync while settling above 12 ms at 1× and 15 ms elsewhere, and above 120 ms once
locked. Nudge `correction = 1 − clamp(EMA(drift) / 3000 ms, ±2 %)` with EMA factor 0.3; while settling at 1× the
gain is 300 ms (spike 4: 0 re-syncs in 30 starts). Re-sync lead learned from the first agreed reading after each
re-sync (0–100 ms). After the first start at a speed, a start moves the learned start lead or media-start latency
only when the value it implies agrees within 10 ms with the one the start before it implied (their mean): one late
media start (a YouTube start that buffers) teaches nothing. **F-3** (both; our design's problem; not spiked; Low):
the 1× settle threshold is
max(12 ms, 2 × `baseLatency` + 1 ms). That equals 12 ms on every machine measured so far (Chrome on macOS:
`baseLatency` ≤ 5.3 ms); Task 23 runs a higher one (D-2). **G-2:** stamps are ignored for 200 ms after a re-sync.
**Speed change** (§6.2, spike 11 §1, High): always re-sync, because every change puts Chrome's media 15–43 ms behind
the synth.

- Produces (used by Tasks 16–19): `MediaStartPlan` (`speed`, `target`, `mediaSeekTo`, `synthSeekTo`, `mediaDelayMs`,
  `catchUpGapMs`); `planStart(target, speed, mediaLatencyMs)`; `started(plan, learnStartLead)`;
  `handOffPlayTime(countInEndFrame, sampleRate, speed, preRollMediaMs)`; `static preRoll(speed, countIn)`.

The start handshake (§6.2), one learned start lead L per speed (the straight-line guess before it is learned, F-9a).
L > 0 means the synth is the slower one, so the media start is delayed by L. L < 0 means the synth starts |L|
earlier in the song.

- At 1×, the synth starts **at** the target and never past it. A positive media latency is caught up by the settle
  nudge, so the threshold allows that gap until the drift is within 2 ms.
- At other speeds both start 60 ms of media time early, and the synth starts where the media will be heard
  (latency applied). Near media time 0 the pre-roll stops at 0: the media can't seek below it.
- L is learned from the median of the first three readings after Play. If a re-sync comes first, it is learned from
  that reading instead. After the first start at a speed, L moves only when two starts in a row agree (Task 9).
- Count-in hand-off: `play()` at `countInEndFrame / sampleRate − (mediaStartLatency(speed) + preRoll / speed)`. The
  media-start latency is learned from the first agreed reading. After the first hand-off at a speed, it moves only when
  two hand-offs in a row agree (Task 9).

**F-14** (both; our design's problem; spiked in spike 6 with an emulated count-in; Medium): the count-in pre-roll
below 1× is 120 ms (0.5× downbeat +4.5…+13.9 ms; 60 ms gave +7.2…+20.5 ms). Decision D-3 re-measures it with the
real count-in. Spike 6's count-in was the song's own beats, stamped on the media's axis, so its end was known a bar
ahead; the real count-in is not stamped, so each of its chunks carries the frames left until it ends (Tasks 3, 6, 7).

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the tests to see them fail**

Run: `npx vitest run test/audio/MediaSyncController.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL — `planStart is not a function`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

Add the plan class to `MediaSyncController.ts`:

```ts
/**
 * Where to start the media and the synthesizer so that a start at `target` is heard together (§6.2).
 * @target web
 * @internal
 */
export class MediaStartPlan {
    public speed: number = 1;
    /** Where playback is meant to be heard from (media ms). */
    public target: number = 0;
    /** Where the media starts: the target, or PreRollMs earlier (never below 0) at speeds other than 1×. */
    public mediaSeekTo: number = 0;
    /** Where the synthesizer starts (media ms). */
    public synthSeekTo: number = 0;
    /** Delay the media's play() by this: the synthesizer is the slower one. */
    public mediaDelayMs: number = 0;
    /** At 1×: the synthesizer starts this far behind (a positive media latency); the settle nudge catches up. */
    public catchUpGapMs: number = 0;
}
```

New fields in `MediaSyncController`:

```ts
    private _learnStartLead: boolean = false;
    private _catchUpGap: number = 0;
    private _catchUpUntil: number = 0;
```

New methods:

```ts
    /**
     * Plans a start at media time `target` (§6.2 start handshake).
     * @param mediaLatencyMs The media's time-stretch latency at this speed (probe value or guess), real ms.
     */
    public planStart(target: number, speed: number, mediaLatencyMs: number): MediaStartPlan {
        const plan = new MediaStartPlan();
        plan.speed = speed;
        plan.target = target;
        const latency = mediaLatencyMs * speed;
        let synthBase: number;
        if (speed === 1) {
            // the synth starts at the target, never past it: a positive latency is caught up by the settle nudge
            plan.mediaSeekTo = target;
            synthBase = target + Math.min(0, latency);
            plan.catchUpGapMs = Math.max(0, latency);
        } else {
            // Chrome's time-stretch distorts the first tens of ms above and below 1×: both start early, and the
            // synth where the media will be heard (spikes 4 and 6). The media can't seek below its time 0.
            plan.mediaSeekTo = Math.max(0, target - MediaSyncConstants.PreRollMs);
            synthBase = plan.mediaSeekTo + latency;
        }
        // learned per speed; the straight-line guess before that (F-9a)
        const lead = this.startLeads.get(speed);
        plan.synthSeekTo = synthBase + Math.min(0, lead) * speed;
        plan.mediaDelayMs = Math.max(0, lead);
        return plan;
    }

    /**
     * Both were told to play as planned: settle, and learn this speed's start lead from the first readings.
     */
    public started(plan: MediaStartPlan, learnStartLead: boolean): void {
        this._begin(plan.speed);
        this._learnStartLead = learnStartLead;
        this._catchUpGap = plan.catchUpGapMs;
        this._catchUpUntil = plan.catchUpGapMs > 0 ? this._settleUntil : 0;
        // while the media start is delayed its readings mean nothing
        this._ignoreUntil = this._time.now() + plan.mediaDelayMs;
    }

    /**
     * The context time (s) at which to issue the media's play() so it is heard from the count-in's end (§6.2).
     */
    public handOffPlayTime(countInEndFrame: number, sampleRate: number, speed: number, preRollMediaMs: number): number {
        return countInEndFrame / sampleRate - (this.mediaStartLatencies.get(speed) + preRollMediaMs / speed) / 1000;
    }

    /**
     * The media pre-roll (media ms) for a start at `speed`.
     */
    public static preRoll(speed: number, countIn: boolean): number {
        if (speed === 1) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (countIn && speed < 1) {
            return MediaSyncConstants.CountInPreRollBelow1xMs;
        }
        return MediaSyncConstants.PreRollMs;
    }

    private _learnStart(speed: number, offset: number): void {
        MediaSyncController._learnFromStart(
            this.startLeads,
            this._learned.lastStartLeads,
            speed,
            this.startLeads.get(speed) - (offset + this._catchUpGap) / speed,
            MediaSyncConstants.StartLeadMinMs,
            MediaSyncConstants.StartLeadMaxMs
        );
    }
```

`_begin` resets the new state:

```diff
         this._learnMediaStartLatency = false;

         this._ignoreUntil = 0;

`onStamp` learns and honors the catch-up gap:

### Task 11: Media clocks (F-11 offset, F-17 stall, F-6 started-by-media)

**Files:**
- Create: `packages/alphatab/src/platform/javascript/MediaClock.ts`
- Create: `packages/alphatab/test/audio/MediaClock.test.ts`
- Modify: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-07-synth-with-media-design.md` (§6.3: sign and unit of the offset, F-11;
  the external clock's time axis, G-6)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `IMediaSyncClock` (Task 9), `PerSpeedValues` (Task 8).
- Produces (used by Tasks 15–20): `IMediaClock` (see "Shared interfaces"); `IBackingTrackClockSource`,
  `AudioElementClockSource`, `BackingTrackMediaClock(source, latencies, offsetMs: () => number)`;
  `IExternalClockSource`, `ExternalMediaClock(source, offsetMs)` with `addSample(positionMs)`,
  `setPlaying(playing)`, `notePausedPosition(position)`, `restartFit()`, `expectJumpTo(target)`,
  `isFromBeforeJump(positionMs)`, `isStalled`, `movedSincePause()`.

§6.3: backing track `mediaTimeAt(frame) = currentTime·1000 − (ctx.currentTime − frame/sampleRate)·1000·speed +
latency(speed)·speed`. External media: a robust line over the last ~2 s of `updatePosition()` calls. Theil–Sen, as
spike 9 §4 measured: it gave one re-sync after a stall, where least squares gave a second one the other way. Both
clocks then subtract the offset.

- **F-11** (alphaTabWebsite; our design's problem; arithmetic only; High): the offset is
  `mediaSyncOffsetInMilliseconds × speed`. A positive value makes the synth play later, and the unit is ms of real
  time.
- **F-17** (alphaTabWebsite; modeled in spike 9 §4; Medium): the same position for ≥ 100 ms after the media has
  moved is a stall. A trigger on the raw samples doesn't lag (a trigger on the fitted line fired 0.3–0.6 s late).
- **F-6** (alphaTabWebsite; not spiked; Low): an update ≤ 100 ms old whose position differs from the paused
  position means the media started itself. The paused position is where the media stopped: it stops up to one
  update after the pause, so an update within 100 ms after the pause sets it (an integration may keep reporting
  while paused, as the rhythm game does for 300 ms after YouTube's `PAUSED`). **G-6:** samples are stamped with
  the context time being heard, and the clock is read at `frame / sampleRate`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests to see them pass**

Run: `npx vitest run test/audio/MediaClock.test.ts`
Expected: PASS (16 tests). If `fits-a-line-that-one-late-update-does-not-bend` misses by more than 0.5 ms, check
that the late sample is the only one changed (`Math.abs(t - 0.5) < 1e-6` must match exactly one step of the loop).

- [ ] **Step 5: State the offset's sign and unit in the spec (F-11, G-6)**

In `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-07-synth-with-media-design.md` §6.3, replace the sentence under the table.

**Before:**
> `mediaSyncOffsetInMilliseconds` is applied to both clocks as a final user adjustment (e.g. Bluetooth).

**After:**
> Both clocks subtract `mediaSyncOffsetInMilliseconds × speed` as a final user adjustment (e.g. Bluetooth): a
> positive value makes the synth play later, in milliseconds of real time at any speed (F-11). The external clock
> stamps each `updatePosition()` sample with the context time being heard (`getOutputTimestamp()`) and is read at
> frame time `F / sampleRate`; that is the moment frame F is heard, so `outputLatency` is not added again.

Then remove the offset from the table's External media cell, so the sentence under the table is the only place
that states it.

**Before:**
> … **heard** (frame time + `outputLatency`), plus `mediaSyncOffsetInMilliseconds` **(untested)**

**After:**
> … **heard** (frame time + `outputLatency`) **(untested)**

- [ ] **Step 6: Run the repo gates and commit**

```bash
npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm test
git add packages/alphatab/src/platform/javascript/MediaClock.ts packages/alphatab/test/audio/MediaClock.test.ts docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-07-synth-with-media-design.md

### Task 12: Latency probe

**Files:**
- Create: `packages/alphatab/src/platform/javascript/MediaLatencyProbe.ts`
- Modify: `packages/alphatab/src/platform/javascript/AlphaSynthAudioWorkletOutput.ts` (register the
  `alphatab-probe-tap` processor in `AlphaSynthWebWorklet.init()`)
- Modify: `packages/alphatab/src/platform/worker/AlphaTabWorkerProtocol.ts` (`alphaSynth.probe.onset`)
- Create: `packages/alphatab/test/audio/MediaLatencyProbe.test.ts`
- Modify: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-07-synth-with-media-design.md` (§13, G-7)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `PerSpeedValues` (Task 8), `IMediaLatencyProbe` (Task 5).
- Produces (used by Tasks 15, 20, 21): `MediaLatencyProbe implements IMediaLatencyProbe` with
  `constructor(context, loadWorkletModule: () => Promise<void>, lengthS?, spacingS?)`, `measure(speed)`; statics
  `cache: PerSpeedValues`
  (per page session), `backgroundSpeeds = [1, 0.5, 0.75, 1.25, 1.5]`, `createProbeWav(sampleRate, lengthS, spacingS)`,
  `latencyFromOnsets(onsets, polls, beepTimes, speed)`; `ProbeWav`, `ProbePoll`.

§6.4: a generated WAV with 2 kHz beeps plays in a hidden `<audio>` at the target speed and is routed into the
synth's AudioContext, into a tap that is never heard. The latency is the median of (currentTime reaching a beep −
the beep being heard). The probe's tap is registered in alphaTab's own worklet module, so it needs no Blob URL
(CSP- and bundler-safe). The spec's ~1 s probe with 125 ms spacing is **untested**: the spike used 4 s with 250 ms
spacing, and Task 22 compares the two. A measurement gives up after the probe's length at that speed plus 2 s: WebKit
may never load or start a hidden `<audio>` outside a gesture, and a measurement that never ends would block every
later one. A measurement whose tap hears fewer than two beeps fails too, rather than giving 0: the first beep is
skipped, so nothing is left to measure (a time-stretch may smear the 3 ms beeps under the tap's threshold). The
schedule (Task 15) then leaves that speed unmeasured.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the tests to see them fail**

Run: `npx vitest run test/audio/MediaLatencyProbe.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL — cannot resolve `MediaLatencyProbe`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Register the tap processor and its message**

Protocol (`AlphaTabWorkerProtocol.ts`), next to the other output messages:

```ts
    | { cmd: 'alphaSynth.probe.onset'; frame: number }
```

In `AlphaSynthWebWorklet` add the tap's values and register the processor at the end of `init()`:

```ts

     * The latency probe's tap: a sample above this starts a beep (spec §6.4).
     */
    public static readonly ProbeTapThreshold: number = 0.25;

     * Frames to wait after an onset (50 ms at 48 kHz): one onset per beep, also at 2×.
     */
    public static readonly ProbeTapCooldownFrames: number = 2400;
```

```ts
        registerProcessor(
            'alphatab-probe-tap',
            class AlphaSynthProbeTapProcessor extends AudioWorkletProcessor {
                private _cooldown: number = 0;

                    // the outputs stay zero: the tap is connected so it is processed, and is never heard (G-7)
                    return true;

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the tests to see them pass**

Run: `npx vitest run test/audio/MediaLatencyProbe.test.ts`
Expected: PASS (8 tests).

- [ ] **Step 6: Fix the §13 wording (G-7)**

In the spec's §13 table, row "Hidden probe playback in the background", replace "Silent (never connected to the
destination)" with "Silent (its tap outputs silence; it is connected so that it is processed)".

- [ ] **Step 7: Run the repo gates and commit**

```bash
npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm test
git add packages/alphatab/src/platform packages/alphatab/test/audio/MediaLatencyProbe.test.ts docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-07-synth-with-media-design.md
git commit -m "feat(web): media latency probe with a tap in alphaTab's own worklet (#2397)"
git push
```

## Phase 4 — The combined player

### Task 13: Volumes on `IAlphaSynth` — `backingTrackVolume`, `synthVolume` (FYI-3 / D-6)

**Files:**
- Modify: `packages/alphatab/src/synth/IAlphaSynth.ts`
- Modify: `packages/alphatab/src/synth/AlphaSynth.ts` (`AlphaSynthBase`)
- Modify: `packages/alphatab/src/synth/BackingTrackPlayer.ts`
- Modify: `packages/alphatab/src/synth/ExternalMediaPlayer.ts`
- Modify: `packages/alphatab/src/synth/AlphaSynthWrapper.ts`
- Modify: `packages/alphatab/src/platform/worker/AlphaSynthWebWorkerApi.ts`
- Modify: `packages/alphatab/src/AlphaTabApiBase.ts`
- Create: `packages/alphatab/test/audio/TestMediaOutput.ts`
- Create: `packages/alphatab/test/audio/MediaVolumes.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces (used by Tasks 15, 19, 20): `IAlphaSynth.backingTrackVolume: number`, `IAlphaSynth.synthVolume: number`;
  `AlphaTabApiBase.backingTrackVolume`, `AlphaTabApiBase.synthVolume`; protected `BackingTrackPlayer.applyMediaVolume()`;
  test helpers `TestMediaOutput` (a backing-track output with `currentTime`, `isPlaying`, `seekTimes`, `advance(ms)`)
  and `TestMediaHandler` (an external-media handler that records `seekTimes`, `plays`, `pauses`).

§7: `backingTrackVolume` scales the backing track's own level (`masterVolume` still scales both). It works without
mixing too: `BackingTrackPlayer` applies `masterVolume × backingTrackVolume` to its `<audio>`, capped at 1 (the
element's volume stops there; a level above 1 needs mixing). `ExternalMediaPlayer`
ignores it, and its handler keeps getting `masterVolume` alone. Otherwise an app that writes its player's volume
back into `masterVolume` drives both toward 0 (spike 9 §3: 239 `volumechange` events, master ~1e-110). Adding
members to `IAlphaSynth` is a minor break for third-party implementations (§7).

- [ ] **Step 0: Decision gate D-6 (FYI-3) — settled in the plan review: `synthVolume` stays public**

Option 1, as §7 says. `backingTrackVolume` and `masterVolume` can't stand in for it with external media:
`backingTrackVolume` is not applied there, and `masterVolume` sets the player's volume and the synth's together
(`_applyVolumes`, Task 15). Nothing to do in this step.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the test helpers**

### Task 14: `WebAudioMixGraph` — gains, limiter and trim (F-13)

**Files:**
- Create: `packages/alphatab/src/platform/javascript/WebAudioMixGraph.ts`
- Create: `packages/alphatab/test/audio/WebAudioMixGraph.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `IMediaMixGraph` (Task 5), `IExternalClockSource` (Task 11).
- Produces (used by Task 20): `WebAudioMixGraph implements IMediaMixGraph, IExternalClockSource` with
  `constructor(context)`, `connectMediaElement(element)`, `synthInput: AudioNode`, the gains, `heardContextTime()`,
  `whenRunning(action)`, and the limiter values as statics.

§3: `<audio> → mediaGain ┐ ├→ masterGain → limiter → destination; worklet → synthGain ┘`, mixing mode only.
**F-13** (both; our design's problem; spiked in spike 8; High): a limiter at −1 dBFS, ratio 20, knee 0, attack 1 ms,
release 100 ms, followed by a fixed −0.57 dB trim that cancels Web Audio's automatic make-up gain. Spike 8: the worst
case peaked at −0.31 dBFS with `synthVolume` 3, and the recording keeps its own level. The spike's −3 dBFS would
squash a mastered recording's own peaks (spike 5: −2.3 dBFS).

### Task 15: `MediaSynthPlayer` — routing, readiness, media-only fallback, volumes, output, probe schedule

**Files:**
- Create: `packages/alphatab/src/platform/javascript/MediaSynthOutput.ts`
- Create: `packages/alphatab/src/platform/javascript/MediaSynthPlayer.ts`
- Modify: `packages/alphatab/src/synth/BackingTrackPlayer.ts` (internal `seekMediaTo`, `tickToMediaTime`,
  `mediaTimeOfPosition`)
- Modify: `packages/alphatab/src/platform/javascript/AlphaTabApi.ts` (a failed SoundFont download is raised on the
  player instance)
- Create: `packages/alphatab/test/audio/MediaSyncFakes.ts`
- Create: `packages/alphatab/test/audio/MediaSynthPlayer.Routing.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `IMediaSynth`, `IMediaFollowingOutput`, `IMediaMixGraph`, `IMediaTimer`, `IMediaLatencyProbe` (Task 5);
  `MediaSyncController` (Tasks 9, 10); `IMediaClock`, `ExternalMediaClock` (Task 11); `MediaLatencyProbe`
  (Task 12); `PerSpeedValues` (Task 8); the volumes (Task 13); `mainTickToMediaTime` (Task 2).
- Produces (used by Tasks 16–21): `MediaSynthPlayerParts`, `MediaSynthPlayer` (with `controller` and
  `diagnostics`), `MediaSynthDiagnostics`, `MediaSynthCountInRecord`, `MediaSynthProbeRecord`, `MediaSynthOutput`;
  on `BackingTrackPlayer` (internal): `seekMediaTo(mediaTime)`, `tickToMediaTime(tick)`, `mediaTimeOfPosition`;
  test helpers `MediaSynthHarness`, `FakeMediaTimer`, `FakeMixGraph`, `FakeMediaSynth`, `FakeFollowingOutput`,
  `FakeBackingClock`, `FakeProbe`, `flush()`.

This task builds the combined `IAlphaSynth` (§6.1) without the handshakes. Here `play()` starts the media alone;
Task 16 adds the synthesizer's start, seek and speed handshakes, Task 17 the count-in, Task 18 the loop wrap,
Task 19 external media. What this task settles:

- **Routing (§6.1):** positions, `finished` and MIDI info come from the media; `midiEventsPlayed` and the
  SoundFont events from the synth. `state` and `stateChanged` belong to the combined player itself: the inner
  players' state changes never reach the app (spike 9 §2).
- **Readiness and the media-only fallback (§6.1, F-8, FYI-4):** without a SoundFont, readiness follows the media
  alone, and the warning says why. The same happens when the worker fails, the worklet fails, or the SoundFont
  fails (including a failed download, now raised on the instance: spike 10 §3). A SoundFont loaded later
  (`api.loadSoundFont()`) ends the fallback: warm-up and probe, and the synth joins from the next Play.
- **Volumes (§6.1):** backing track — `masterGain` (both), `mediaGain` = `backingTrackVolume`,
  `synthGain` = `synthVolume`, while the `<audio>` itself stays at 1. External — the handler gets `masterVolume`
  alone, and `masterGain` scales the synth.
- **`output` (§6.1):** the media output's members pass through (`audioElement`, `handler`, `updatePosition`,
  `timeUpdate`); the device methods come from the synth output, because the media now plays through its
  AudioContext.
- **Probe schedule (§6.4):** 1, 0.5, 0.75, 1.25, 1.5× in the background after ready, one at a time, waiting for a
  running AudioContext. A speed without a value goes to the front. A failure (refused, no result within the
  probe's time limit, or fewer than two beeps heard, Task 12) is not a measured 0: that speed stays unmeasured, so
  the guess applies, and it is measured again on its next use (a Play or a speed change).

- [ ] **Step 1: BackingTrackPlayer helpers**

Add to `BackingTrackPlayer` (all `@internal`):

```ts
    /**
     * Seeks to a time on the media's own axis (the combined player's handshakes).
     * @internal
     */
    public seekMediaTo(mediaTime: number): void {
        const timePosition = this.sequencer.mainTimePositionFromBackingTrack(
            mediaTime,
            this._backingTrackOutput.backingTrackDuration
        );
        this.timePosition = Math.max(0, timePosition);
        if (timePosition < 0) {
            // before bar 1 (a recording with a lead-in) the song position is negative, and the seek back from it
            // would land at media time 0: the cursor waits at the song's start, the media goes to the time itself
            // (the later seek wins)
            this._backingTrackOutput.seekTo(mediaTime);
        }
    }

    /**
     * The media time at which the main song reaches `tick` (the spec §4 mapping; without sync points the media
     * time is the song time).
     * @internal
     */
    public tickToMediaTime(tick: number): number {
        return this.sequencer.mainTickToMediaTime(tick, this._backingTrackOutput.backingTrackDuration);
    }

    /**
     * The media time this player seeks the media to for its current position.
     * @internal
     */
    public get mediaTimeOfPosition(): number {
        return this.sequencer.mainTimePositionToBackingTrack(
            this.timePosition,
            this._backingTrackOutput.backingTrackDuration
        );
    }
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Raise a failed SoundFont download on the player instance (F-8)**

In `AlphaTabApi.loadSoundFontFromUrl` (`packages/alphatab/src/platform/javascript/AlphaTabApi.ts`):

```diff
         request.onerror = e => {
             Logger.error('AlphaSynth', `Loading failed: ${(e as any).message}`);
-            (player.soundFontLoadFailed as EventEmitterOfT<Error>).trigger(
+            // raised on the instance so a combined player can fall back to the media alone (spike 10 §3);
+            // the wrapper forwards it to the app as before
+            const instance = (player as AlphaSynthWrapper).instance ?? player;
+            (instance.soundFontLoadFailed as EventEmitterOfT<Error>).trigger(
                 new FileLoadError((e as any).message, request)
             );
         };
```

(import `type AlphaSynthWrapper` from `@coderline/alphatab/synth/AlphaSynthWrapper`.)

- [ ] **Step 3: The output passthrough**

Create `packages/alphatab/src/platform/javascript/MediaSynthOutput.ts`:

```ts

```

Notes for the implementer:
- `soundFontLoadFailed` is declared with an initializer, and the constructor subscribes to it. Field initializers run
  before the constructor body, so the subscription is safe.
- Task 16 replaces `_startPlayback` and `_seek` with the synthesizer's start and seek handshakes. Its `_startPlayback`
  keeps this one's first three lines: a Play measures the playing speed next when it has no value (§6.4).

- [ ] **Step 8: Run the tests to see them pass**

Run: `npx vitest run test/audio/MediaSynthPlayer.Routing.test.ts`
Expected: PASS (15 tests).

- [ ] **Step 9: Run the repo gates and commit**

```bash
npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm test
git add packages/alphatab/src packages/alphatab/test/audio/MediaSyncFakes.ts packages/alphatab/test/audio/MediaSynthPlayer.Routing.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(web): combined player: routing, readiness, media-only fallback, volumes, probe schedule (#2397)"

### Task 16: `MediaSynthPlayer` — start, seek and speed handshakes; one-time MIDI; song end

**Files:**
- Modify: `packages/alphatab/src/platform/javascript/MediaSynthPlayer.ts`
- Create: `packages/alphatab/test/audio/MediaSynthPlayer.Transport.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 15's player; `MediaSyncController.planStart/started` (Task 10) and `speedChanged` (Task 9);
  `IMediaClock.whenSeeked` (Task 11); `BackingTrackPlayer.seekMediaTo` (Task 15).
- Produces (used by Tasks 17–19): `_startPlayback()`, `_runStart(plan, learnStartLead)`, `_interrupt()` with the
  handshake counter, `_holdBefore` for positions, `_mediaDelayTimer`.

§6.2. **Start:** follow config, then plan the start. The media seeks to the plan's start, and only after the seek
the synth seeks and plays and the media plays (delayed by L when the synth is slower). The controller settles.
**Seek while playing (backing track):** pause both, seek, restart through the start handshake, with no count-in and
no `stateChanged`. **Speed change while playing:** both get the new speed and the clock its latency, then a re-sync
and settle (spike 11: Chrome's media lands 15–43 ms behind on every change). **Cursor:** positions from before the
start are held back during the media's pre-roll, so the cursor doesn't jump back. **`playBeat` / `playNote` while
playing (§6.1, spike 7):** pause both (the app sees Paused); the synth leaves follow mode and plays the beat on its
own clock; the next Play follows the media again. **Song end:** when the media reaches the song's end (its last sync
point), the media player's own end check fires `finished` once and both stop, as today: an outro after the last bar
is not played. **Today's behavior kept:** `BackingTrackPlayer.updatePlaybackSpeed` also seeks
the `<audio>` to its last reported position, which the `<audio>` output refreshes every 50 ms, so the recording
jumps back up to 50 ms × speed at each change. That is the media player's own logic (§4, "not changed"); the clock
reads no time while that seek runs, so the re-sync waits for it. Task 22 Step 6 measures whether this seek, rather
than Chrome, puts the media behind at each change (decision gate D-9).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the tests to see them fail**

Run: `npx vitest run test/audio/MediaSynthPlayer.Transport.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL — e.g. `play-reports-playing-at-once-and-starts-both-at-the-target` sees no synth calls.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement the handshakes**

In `MediaSynthPlayer.ts` import `type MediaStartPlan` from `MediaSyncController`, and add the fields:

```ts
    private _handshake: number = 0;
    private _holdBefore: number = -1;
    private _mediaDelayTimer: number = 0;
```

Replace `_startPlayback`, `_seek`, `_interrupt`, `_onMediaPosition` and `_onMediaFinished`, and add `_runStart`,
`_mediaLatency` and the `_isMixing` getter (first used here, so it is declared here: an unread private member
fails `noUnusedLocals`):

```ts
    /**
     * Starts from the media's position (§6.2 start handshake).
     */
    private _startPlayback(): void {
        const speed = this.playbackSpeed;
        this._queueProbe(speed, true);
        this._probeNext();
        if (!this._isMixing) {
            this._playMedia();
            return;
        }
        this._sendFollowConfig();
        this._runStart(this.controller.planStart(this._clock.position, speed, this._mediaLatency(speed)), true);
    }

    private _runStart(plan: MediaStartPlan, learnStartLead: boolean): void {
        // the cursor stays at the start position while the media pre-rolls
        this._holdBefore = this._media.timePosition;
        // ends a one-time MIDI the synth may still play (spike 7)
        this._synth.pause();
        if (plan.mediaSeekTo !== this._clock.position) {
            this._media.seekMediaTo(plan.mediaSeekTo);
        }
        const handshake = this._handshake;
        this._clock.whenSeeked(() => {
            if (handshake !== this._handshake) {
                // a pause or another handshake came first
                return;
            }
            this._synth.seekToMediaTime(plan.synthSeekTo);
            this._synth.play();
            if (plan.mediaDelayMs > 0) {
                this._mediaDelayTimer = this._timer.setTimeout(() => {
                    this._mediaDelayTimer = 0;
                    this._playMedia();
                }, plan.mediaDelayMs);
            } else {
                this._playMedia();
            }
            this.controller.started(plan, learnStartLead);
        });
    }

    private _seek(apply: () => void): void {
        if (this._state !== PlayerState.Playing) {
            apply();
            return;
        }
        // pause both, seek, restart through the start handshake: no count-in, no stateChanged (§6.2)
        this._interrupt();
        apply();
        this._startPlayback();
    }

    /**
     * Stops whatever a handshake has in flight; both end paused.
     */
    private _interrupt(): void {
        this._handshake++;
        this._timer.clearTimeout(this._mediaDelayTimer);
        this._mediaDelayTimer = 0;
        this._holdBefore = -1;
        this.controller.stopped();
        this._pauseMedia();
        this._synth.pause();
    }

    /**
     * Both play: the synthesizer is ready and nothing failed.
     */
    private get _isMixing(): boolean {
        return !this._isMediaOnly && this._synthReadyForPlayback;
    }

    private _mediaLatency(speed: number): number {
        return this._externalClock ? 0 : this._probeLatencies.get(speed);
    }

    private _onMediaPosition(e: PositionChangedEventArgs): void {
        if (this._holdBefore >= 0) {
            if (e.currentTime < this._holdBefore - 1) {
                // the media's pre-roll: keep the cursor at the start position (§6.1)
                return;
            }
            this._holdBefore = -1;
        }
        (this.positionChanged as EventEmitterOfT<PositionChangedEventArgs>).trigger(e);
    }

    private _onMediaFinished(): void {
        // the media reached the song's end by itself (no range, not looping): finished, and both stop, as today
        (this.finished as EventEmitter).trigger();
        if (this._state === PlayerState.Playing) {
            this._interrupt();
            this._synth.stop();
            this._setState(PlayerState.Paused, true);
        }
    }
```

The speed setter gets the handshake, and ignores a speed it already has: apps feed the media's rate event back
(YouTube's `onPlaybackRateChange`, the rhythm game's `ratechange`):

```diff
     public set playbackSpeed(value: number) {
+        if (value === this.playbackSpeed) {
+            // a second handshake would seek the media again and re-sync, cutting the synth's sounding notes
+            return;
+        }
         this._media.playbackSpeed = value;
@@
         this._clock.speed = speed;
         this._queueProbe(speed, true);
         this._probeNext();
+        if (this._state === PlayerState.Playing && this._isMixing) {
+            // both at the new speed with its latency: re-sync and settle (§6.2; spike 11)
+            this.controller.speedChanged(speed);
+        }
     }
```

and the one-time MIDI:

```ts
    public playOneTimeMidiFile(midi: MidiFile): void {
        if (!this._isMixing) {
            // the media player's own behavior, as today (§8)
            this._media.playOneTimeMidiFile(midi);
            return;
        }
        // pause both (the app sees Paused); the synth leaves follow mode and plays it on its own clock; the next
        // Play follows the media again through the start handshake (§6.1, spike 7)
        this.pause();
        this._synth.followMedia(false, this._mediaDuration, this._syncPoints);
        this._synth.playOneTimeMidiFile(midi);
    }
```

`destroy()` already calls `_interrupt()`, which now clears the media-delay timer.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests to see them pass**

Run: `npx vitest run test/audio/MediaSynthPlayer.Transport.test.ts test/audio/MediaSynthPlayer.Routing.test.ts`
Expected: PASS. If `the-song-end-stops-both-once` sees no `finished`, check that `TestMediaOutput.advance` crosses the
song's end on the media (its last sync point, 42004.7 ms): `BackingTrackPlayer.checkForFinish` fires `finished` once
the tick passes the song's end.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the repo gates and commit**

```bash
npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm test
git add packages/alphatab/src/platform/javascript/MediaSynthPlayer.ts packages/alphatab/test/audio/MediaSynthPlayer.Transport.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(web): combined player start, seek and speed handshakes (#2397)"
git push
```

### Task 17: `MediaSynthPlayer` — count-in hand-off (G-5) and the refused-start safety net (R-2)

**Files:**
- Modify: `packages/alphatab/src/platform/javascript/MediaSynthPlayer.ts`
- Create: `packages/alphatab/test/audio/MediaSynthPlayer.CountIn.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `IMediaSynth.countInStarted` (Task 5), `IMediaFollowingOutput.countInEnd` (Task 7),
  `MediaSyncController.handOffPlayTime/preRoll` (Task 10), `MediaSyncController.startedAfterHandOff` and
  `MediaSyncConstants` (Task 9), `IMediaTimer.spinUntil` (Task 5).
- Produces (used by Tasks 18, 19): `_startPlayback(countIn: boolean)`, `_countIn` (non-null while counting in),
  `_watchMediaStart(delayMs)`, `MediaSynthCountInRecord` entries in `diagnostics.countIns`.

§6.2 count-in: only an app Play from Paused counts in (§6.1). The worker renders one bar and then the song in one
stream (Task 4), while the media waits, paused, at its pre-roll start (60 ms above 1×, 120 ms below, F-14). From
the count-in's first buffered chunk on, the worklet reports the context frame of its end, a bar ahead, and refines
it about every 50 ms (Task 7: each count-in chunk carries the frames left until the count-in ends); each report
plans the hand-off again. The worklet's ~213 ms buffer is shorter than the 240 ms lead the 0.5× pre-roll needs,
so the chunk after the count-in comes too late to plan from. The media's `play()` is issued at
`frame / sampleRate − (mediaStartLatency(speed) + preRoll / speed)`. **G-5:** the timer fires 12 ms early, then
waits on the audio clock for at most 30 ms (spike 6: `play()` 0.2–4.8 ms after its time). If the count-in's end
isn't reported by the count-in's length + 250 ms, the media starts anyway and this player turns media-only; an end
that was reported but lands later (a late audio start) still hands off. The cursor stays
at the start position. **R-2 safety net** (not spiked; Low): WebKit may refuse a `play()` a bar after the gesture,
and any other `play()` that runs after the Play call returned: away from 1× the start handshake plays the media from
the pre-roll seek's `'seeked'` event, and a learned media delay plays it from a timer. If the media isn't running
500 ms after any planned start, both pause and a warning is logged. External media is the exception (Task 19): the
synth goes silent and restarts once the media moves, with no pause and no warning. Decision D-7 (Task 24) picks the
real fallback.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the tests to see them fail**

Run: `npx vitest run test/audio/MediaSynthPlayer.CountIn.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL — `play-with-count-in-starts-the-synth-alone` sees `play:countIn=0` and a playing media.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

Import `MediaSyncConstants` (value) from `MediaSyncController`. Add above `MediaSynthPlayer`:

```ts
/**
 * One count-in hand-off in flight.
 * @target web
 * @internal
 */
class CountInHandOff {
    public readonly target: number;
    /** The speed of the Play: the synthesizer measures the count-in's length at it. */
    public readonly startSpeed: number;
    public speed: number;
    public preRoll: number;
    /** The count-in's length at speed 1 (ms); 0 until the synthesizer reports it. */
    public lengthAt1x: number = 0;
    /** The context frame of the count-in's end; -1 until the worklet reports it. */
    public endFrame: number = -1;
    /** The context time (s) for the media's play(); -1 until the count-in end is known. */
    public playAt: number = -1;
    public handOffTimer: number = 0;
    public limitTimer: number = 0;
    /** The speed changed during the count-in: the hand-off doesn't learn the media-start latency. */
    public speedChanged: boolean = false;

    public constructor(target: number, speed: number, preRoll: number) {
        this.target = target;
        this.startSpeed = speed;
        this.speed = speed;
        this.preRoll = preRoll;
    }
}
```

Fields and subscriptions:

```ts
    private _countIn: CountInHandOff | null = null;
    private _mediaStartCheckTimer: number = 0;
```

```ts
        // in the constructor, after the mediaTimestamp subscription
        subscribe(this._synthOutput.countInEnd.on(frame => this._onCountInEnd(frame)));
        subscribe(synth.countInStarted.on(lengthMs => this._onCountInStarted(lengthMs)));
```

Only an app Play counts in:

```diff
         this._setState(PlayerState.Playing, false);
-        this._startPlayback();
+        // an app Play from Paused is the only start that counts in (§6.1)
+        this._startPlayback(true);
         return true;
@@
-    private _startPlayback(): void {
+    private _startPlayback(countIn: boolean): void {
@@
         this._sendFollowConfig();
-        this._runStart(this.controller.planStart(this._clock.position, speed, this._mediaLatency(speed)), true);
+        const target = this._clock.position;
+        if (countIn && this._countInVolume > 0) {
+            this._startCountIn(target, speed);
+            return;
+        }
+        this._runStart(this.controller.planStart(target, speed, this._mediaLatency(speed)), true);
     }
@@ (in _seek)
-        this._startPlayback();
+        this._startPlayback(false);
```

`_interrupt` cancels a count-in and the start check:

```diff
         this._timer.clearTimeout(this._mediaDelayTimer);
         this._mediaDelayTimer = 0;
+        this._timer.clearTimeout(this._mediaStartCheckTimer);
+        this._mediaStartCheckTimer = 0;
+        this._cancelCountIn();
         this._holdBefore = -1;
```

`_runStart` checks every media start, not only the count-in's (R-2):

```diff
             this.controller.started(plan, learnStartLead);
+            // R-2: away from 1x (after the pre-roll seek) or after the media delay, the media's play() runs after the
+            // Play call returned; check that the media runs, as after a count-in
+            this._watchMediaStart(
+                plan.mediaDelayMs + this.controller.mediaStartLatencies.get(plan.speed) + MediaSyncConstants.MediaStartCheckMs
+            );
         });
```

A speed change during the count-in doesn't re-sync. The worker plays the clicks still to come at the new speed (its
sequencer advances the count-in at the current speed), so the hand-off follows it (Review Focus 2):

```diff
-        if (this._state === PlayerState.Playing && this._isMixing) {
+        if (this._state === PlayerState.Playing && this._isMixing && !this._countIn) {
             // both at the new speed with its latency: re-sync and settle (§6.2; spike 11)
             this.controller.speedChanged(speed);
         }
+        if (this._countIn) {
+            this._retimeCountIn(this._countIn, speed);
+        }
```

New methods:

```ts
    private _startCountIn(target: number, speed: number): void {
        // the media can't wait below its time 0: near it the pre-roll shrinks (the hand-off time uses this value)

        // the cursor stays at the start position meanwhile

### Task 18: `MediaSynthPlayer` — playback range and the loop wrap (G-3)

**Files:**
- Modify: `packages/alphatab/src/platform/javascript/MediaSynthPlayer.ts`
- Create: `packages/alphatab/test/audio/MediaSynthPlayer.Loop.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `BackingTrackPlayer.tickToMediaTime` (Task 15), the handshakes (Tasks 16, 17).
- Produces (used by Task 19): `_scheduleWrap(extraDelayMs)`, `_wrapEnd()`, `_onWrapTimer()`, `_wrap()`, `_wrapTimer`.

§6.2 loop wrap: the combined player owns `playbackRange` and `isLooping`. When no range is set, the song's end
counts as the range end, so `isLooping` alone loops the whole song, as today. Just before the range end it fires
`finished`, pauses both, seeks both to the range start (60 ms earlier at speeds other than 1×, from the start plan)
and restarts them through the start handshake, with no count-in and no `stateChanged`. Spike 4 measured this:
0 missing clicks at 0.5×, 1× and 1.5×, under 15 ms per wrap at 1× and ~24 ms at 0.5× and 1.5×. With `isLooping`
off, the range end fires `finished` and stops both at the range start, as today. **G-3** (spike 4): the timer
fires 15 ms of media time before the end as heard: below 1× the media is heard its latency × speed ahead of the
position it reports (§6.3, as in the start plan), and timed from that position the bar after the range would start
to sound. If the media is behind (a late start), it waits for the media. If the
timer is late (a busy main thread), the first media update at or past the end wraps at once: it comes before the
media player's own end check, which would otherwise stop both at the song's end.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the tests to see them fail**

Run: `npx vitest run test/audio/MediaSynthPlayer.Loop.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL — no `finished` at the range end.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

Field: `private _wrapTimer: number = 0;`. `_interrupt` clears it:

```diff
+        this._timer.clearTimeout(this._wrapTimer);
+        this._wrapTimer = 0;
         this._cancelCountIn();
```

Schedule the wrap wherever playback (re)starts or its timing changes:

```diff
@@ _startPlayback (media-only branch)
         if (!this._isMixing) {
             this._playMedia();
+            this._scheduleWrap(0);
             return;
         }
@@ _runStart (inside whenSeeked, after controller.started)
             this.controller.started(plan, learnStartLead);
+            this._scheduleWrap(plan.mediaDelayMs);
             // R-2: away from 1x (after the pre-roll seek) or after the media delay, the media's play() runs after the
@@ _handOff (at the end)
         this._watchMediaStart(this.controller.mediaStartLatencies.get(countIn.speed) + MediaSyncConstants.MediaStartCheckMs);
+        this._scheduleWrap(0);
@@ _onCountInTimeLimit (at the end)
         this._playMedia();
+        this._scheduleWrap(0);
@@ playbackSpeed setter (at the end)
+        if (this._state === PlayerState.Playing) {
+            this._scheduleWrap(0);

+        this._scheduleWrap(0);
@@ isLooping setter
         this._isLooping = value;
+        this._scheduleWrap(0);
```

`_onMediaPosition` — a backstop for a late timer (G-3). The media player raises `positionChanged` before its own end
check in the same update, so a wrap here comes first:

```diff
         (this.positionChanged as EventEmitterOfT<PositionChangedEventArgs>).trigger(e);
+        if (this._wrapTimer !== 0 && !e.isSeek) {
+            const range = this._playbackRange;
+            const endTick = range ? range.endTick : this._media.loadedMidiInfo!.endTick;
+            if (e.currentTick >= endTick) {
+                // the media passed the wrap point before the timer fired (a busy main thread): wrap now, before the
+                // media player's own end check stops both at the song's end
+                this._timer.clearTimeout(this._wrapTimer);
+                this._wrapTimer = 0;
+                this._wrap();
+            }
+        }
     }
```

```ts

### Task 19: `MediaSynthPlayer` — external media (F-5, F-6, F-17)

**Files:**
- Modify: `packages/alphatab/src/platform/javascript/MediaSynthPlayer.ts`
- Create: `packages/alphatab/test/audio/MediaSynthPlayer.External.test.ts`
- Modify: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-07-synth-with-media-design.md` (§1 S10 scope, F-5; §7 the
  `updatePosition()` call, F-6)
- Modify: `packages/playground/src/components/youtube-sync/YoutubeSync.ts` (one more `updatePosition()` when the
  video pauses)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `ExternalMediaClock` (`addSample`, `setPlaying`, `notePausedPosition`, `restartFit`, `expectJumpTo`,
  `isFromBeforeJump`, `isStalled`, `movedSincePause`) (Task 11); `MediaSynthOutput.skipPosition` (Task 15); the
  handshakes (Tasks 16–18).
- Produces (used by Task 20): the external-media flows below. No new public members.

External media is best-effort (S9). It can't be held, so a seek or a wrap happens while it plays, and its
position arrives through the app's `updatePosition()` calls. Our design's problems, all **(untested)** except
F-17's model:

- **Seek while playing (§6.2):** the synth stays silent until the media shows the jump and its clock has a fit
  again (three updates over 100 ms or more), then restarts at the media's position. There's no count-in and no learning; the settling re-sync locks it. Updates that still show
  the old position stop at the player's output: the media player's cursor and end check never see them. A seek the
  media hasn't shown after a second is given up, and its updates count again. If the media then holds at the
  target (buffering), the held updates stay out of the clock's line: it is fitted from where the media moves on, as
  after a stall.
- **F-5** (alphaTabWebsite; Low): a wrap doesn't pause the media. It seeks to the range start, then does what a
  seek does, so the synth restarts past the range start (about 110–160 ms at 1× with the rhythm game's 50 ms
  updates): every pass of a YouTube loop plays its first beat without a click. S10 is scoped to the backing track.
- **F-6** (alphaTabWebsite; Low): when the position moved since the pause (an update at most 100 ms old), the start
  came from the media's own player. The synth then starts at the media's position, with no count-in and no
  learning.
- **F-17** (alphaTabWebsite; modeled in spike 9 §4; Medium): the same position for 100 ms or more silences the
  synth. On the first update that moves, the fit restarts there; the synth restarts at the media's position once
  the clock has a fit again (three updates over 100 ms or more).
- **A media that hasn't started 500 ms after its planned start** (buffering): the synth goes silent and restarts
  once the media moves.
- **Media only** (no SoundFont, or the synth failed): there is no synth to restart after a jump (a seek or a wrap),
  so the next wrap is planned once the media reports from its new position.
- **A start through alphaTab** begins where alphaTab put the paused media, which is only as exact as the media's last
  update: the media stops up to one update after it, and at 1× nothing seeks it, so §7 asks integrations to report
  once more when the media pauses. Stop, a range end and the song's end move
  it with no update from the media, and an integration may report positions only while the media plays (the
  youtube-sync demo). Inside a lead-in (before bar 1) only the media's own update knows its position.
- **Every start** fits the clock from the media's first update that moves, as after a stall: the paused position, and
  the updates an integration sends while the media starts (YouTube's clock starts ~45 ms after `playVideo()`, spike 6),
  would bend the first fit and the start values learned from it.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the tests to see them fail**

Run: `npx vitest run test/audio/MediaSynthPlayer.External.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL — e.g. the seek pauses the external media through the backing-track handshake.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

Fields:

```ts
    private _awaitingSynthStart: boolean = false;
    private _stalled: boolean = false;
    private _refitOnMove: boolean = false;
```

Subscribe to the media's position updates, and keep updates from before a seek out of the media player
(constructor):

```ts
        subscribe((media.output as IBackingTrackSynthOutput).timeUpdate.on(t => this._onMediaTimeUpdate(t)));
        const externalClock = this._externalClock;
        if (externalClock) {
            // after a seek the media reports its old position for a moment (spike 9): those updates stop here, before
            // the media player's cursor and end check
            this._output.skipPosition = position => externalClock.isFromBeforeJump(position);
        }
```

`_interrupt` resets the external state:

```diff
         this._holdBefore = -1;
+        this._awaitingSynthStart = false;
+        this._stalled = false;
+        this._refitOnMove = false;
         this.controller.stopped();
```

`_startPlayback` — a start inside the media (F-6), after the media-only branch; a start through alphaTab begins at
alphaTab's own position:

```diff
         if (!this._isMixing) {
             this._playMedia();
             this._scheduleWrap(0);
             return;
         }
+        const external = this._externalClock;
+        if (external && external.movedSincePause()) {
+            // F-6: play was pressed inside the media's own player and it already moves:
+            // no count-in, no learning; the synth starts where the media is
+            this._playMedia();
+            this._awaitingSynthStart = true;
+            this._startSynthWhenTheMediaRuns();
+            return;
+        }
         this._sendFollowConfig();
-        const target = this._clock.position;
+        // external media: alphaTab may have moved the paused media since its last update (a Stop, the song's end), so
+        // start from alphaTab's own position; inside a lead-in (before bar 1) only the media's updates know where it is
+        const target =
+            external && this._media.timePosition >= 0 ? this._media.mediaTimeOfPosition : this._clock.position;
```

`_runStart` already checks every media start (Task 17); for external media the check silences the synth instead of
pausing (next).

`_watchMediaStart` — external media restarts the synth when it moves, instead of pausing:

```diff
                 return;
             }
+            if (this._externalClock) {
+                // the video buffers: the synth restarts at the media's position once it moves (§6.2)
+                this._silenceUntilTheMediaMoves();

+            }
             // R-2: the browser refused the media's play(); decision D-7 picks the real fallback
```

`_seek` — external media jumps while it plays; a paused seek is not a start:

```ts
    private _seek(apply: () => void): void {
        if (this._state !== PlayerState.Playing) {
            apply();
            this._externalClock?.notePausedPosition(this._media.mediaTimeOfPosition);
            return;
        }
        if (this._externalClock && !this._countIn) {
            // external media can't be held: it jumps while playing, the synth waits for it (§6.2)
            this._timer.clearTimeout(this._wrapTimer);
            this._wrapTimer = 0;
            apply();
            this._jumpExternal(this._media.mediaTimeOfPosition);
            return;
        }
        // pause both, seek, restart through the start handshake: no count-in, no stateChanged (§6.2)
        this._interrupt();
        apply();
        this._startPlayback(false);
    }
```

`_wrap` — F-5, before the backing-track wrap:

```diff
         this.diagnostics.wraps.push(this._timer.now());
+        const range = this._playbackRange;
+        if (this._externalClock) {
+            // F-5: external media wraps without pausing: seek it; the synth waits until its clock has a fit again
+            // without a range the song's start: bar 1's media time, as the backing-track wrap and today's player go
+            const start = this._media.tickToMediaTime(range ? range.startTick : 0);
+            this._media.seekMediaTo(start);
+            this._jumpExternal(start);
+            return;
+        }
         // pause both, seek both to the range start, restart through the start handshake (§6.2):
         // no count-in, no stateChanged
         this._interrupt();
-        const range = this._playbackRange;
         if (range) {
```

Speed change — the fit is at the old rate:

```diff
         if (this._state === PlayerState.Playing && this._isMixing && !this._countIn) {
+            // the fitted line is at the old rate
+            this._externalClock?.restartFit();
             // both at the new speed with its latency: re-sync and settle (§6.2; spike 11)
             this.controller.speedChanged(speed);
         }
```

`_playMedia` — every start fits the external clock from where the media moves, as after a stall:

```diff
     private _playMedia(): void {
         this._externalClock?.setPlaying(true);
+        // external media: the paused position and the updates while the media starts would bend the first fit: fit
+        // from where it moves, as after a stall
+        this._refitOnMove = true;
         this._media.play();
     }
```

New methods:

```ts
    private _onMediaTimeUpdate(position: number): void {
        const clock = this._externalClock;
        if (!clock) {
            return;
        }
        if (
            (this._awaitingSynthStart || Number.isNaN(clock.mediaTimeNow())) &&

            this._refitOnMove = true;
        }
        if (this._refitOnMove && position !== clock.position) {
            // the media moves (again): fit from here; a fit across a stall re-syncs twice (spike 9 §4)
            this._refitOnMove = false;
            this._stalled = false;
            clock.restartFit();
        }

    private _jumpExternal(target: number): void {

```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests to see them pass**

Run: `npx vitest run test/audio/MediaSynthPlayer.External.test.ts` and then all `MediaSynthPlayer.*` tests.
Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 5: Update the spec (F-5, F-6)**

§1, row S10, add at the end of the criterion cell: "Backing track only: external media wraps without pausing and
stays best-effort (S9)."

§7, after the paragraph that starts "External media: hide the player's own controls", add:

> If your integration starts alphaTab from the media's own play event (for example YouTube's `PLAYING` state),
> call `updatePosition()` right before `api.play()`: alphaTab then sees that the media already moves and starts
> the synthesizer at its position, with no count-in (F-6).
>
> When the media pauses, call `updatePosition()` once more (YouTube: at its `PAUSED` state, before you stop your
> timer), so the next start through alphaTab begins where the media stopped, not where it was one update earlier.

In the playground's `youtube-sync` demo (`packages/playground/src/components/youtube-sync/YoutubeSync.ts`), report
the position once more when the video pauses:

```diff
             case 2: // paused
+                // the video stops up to one update after the last one: report where it stopped (spec §7)
+                if (this.player) {
+                    const output = this.api.player?.output as alphaTab.synth.IExternalMediaSynthOutput | undefined;
+                    output?.updatePosition(this.player.getCurrentTime() * 1000);
+                }
                 this.clearInterval();
                 this.api.pause();
                 break;
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Run the repo gates and commit**

```bash
npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm test
git add packages/alphatab/src/platform/javascript/MediaSynthPlayer.ts packages/alphatab/test/audio/MediaSynthPlayer.External.test.ts docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-07-synth-with-media-design.md packages/playground/src/components/youtube-sync/YoutubeSync.ts
git commit -m "feat(web): external media seeks, wraps, stalls and starts inside the media (#2397, F-5, F-6, F-17)"

### Task 20: Settings and wiring

**Files:**
- Modify: `packages/alphatab/src/PlayerSettings.ts`
- Regenerate: `packages/alphatab/src/generated/*` (`npm run generate-typescript`)
- Modify: `packages/alphatab/src/platform/IUiFacade.ts`
- Modify: `packages/alphatab/test/visualTests/TestUiFacade.ts`
- Modify: `packages/alphatab/src/platform/javascript/BrowserUiFacade.ts`
- Modify: `packages/alphatab/src/AlphaTabApiBase.ts` (`_setupOrDestroyPlayer`)
- Create: `packages/alphatab/test/audio/MediaSynthWiring.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: everything above.
- Produces (used by Tasks 21–27): `PlayerSettings.enableSynthesizerWithMedia`,
  `PlayerSettings.mediaSyncOffsetInMilliseconds`, `IUiFacade.createMediaSynthPlayer(mode: PlayerMode): IAlphaSynth | null`,
  the combined player in the browser.

§7 wiring: when the resolved mode is `EnabledBackingTrack` or `EnabledExternalMedia` and the switch is on,
`_setupOrDestroyPlayer` asks `uiFacade.createMediaSynthPlayer(mode)`. Web returns a `MediaSynthPlayer`; other
platforms return null and get today's media-only player. Web also returns null, and logs a warning, when
`outputMode` isn't `WebAudioAudioWorklets` or AudioWorklets are unavailable (no `AudioWorkletNode`, or not a secure
context). The player is also recreated when the switch changes through `updateSettings()` (Review Focus 4). With
the switch off nothing changes (S7).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

Create `packages/alphatab/test/audio/MediaSynthWiring.test.ts`:

```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the tests to see them fail**

Run: `npx vitest run test/audio/MediaSynthWiring.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL — `enableSynthesizerWithMedia` doesn't exist.

- [ ] **Step 3: The settings**

`PlayerSettings.ts`, after `bufferTimeInMilliseconds`:

```ts
    /**
     * Whether the synthesizer plays along a backing track or external media.
     * @since 1.9.0
     * @defaultValue `false`
     * @category Player
     * @remarks
     * With {@link playerMode} resolving to {@link PlayerMode.EnabledBackingTrack} or
     * {@link PlayerMode.EnabledExternalMedia}, alphaTab also runs its synthesizer, locked to the media: the
     * metronome, the count-in and the score's tracks (use the track mute, solo and volume to choose what plays).
     * The media stays the time source. Balance the two with `api.backingTrackVolume` and `api.synthVolume`.
     *
     * Needs {@link outputMode} {@link PlayerOutputMode.WebAudioAudioWorklets} and a browser with AudioWorklets (a
     * secure context); otherwise the media plays alone and a warning is logged. Web only: other platforms play the
     * media alone.
     *
     * External media is best-effort: tune {@link mediaSyncOffsetInMilliseconds} by ear. Hide the external player's
     * own controls (YouTube: `controls: 0`, `disablekb: 1`) so starts go through your Play button and keep their
     * count-in. If your integration starts alphaTab from the media's own play event, call `updatePosition()` right
     * before `api.play()`: alphaTab then starts the synthesizer where the media already is, without a count-in.
     * When the media pauses, call `updatePosition()` once more (YouTube: at its `PAUSED` state, before you stop your
     * timer), so the next start through alphaTab begins where the media stopped, not where it was one update earlier.
     */
    public enableSynthesizerWithMedia: boolean = false;

    /**
     * A manual correction of the synthesizer against the media, in milliseconds.
     * @since 1.9.0
     * @defaultValue `0`
     * @category Player
     * @remarks
     * Positive values make the synthesizer play later, negative values earlier, in milliseconds of real time at any
     * playback speed. Use it for output paths alphaTab can't measure, like Bluetooth headphones or an external
     * media player. Only used with {@link enableSynthesizerWithMedia}.
     */
    public mediaSyncOffsetInMilliseconds: number = 0;
```

Then regenerate the JSON types and serializers:

```bash
npm run generate-typescript
```

Expected: `packages/alphatab/src/generated/PlayerSettingsJson.ts` and the serializer gain both members.

- [ ] **Step 4: The UI facade member**

`IUiFacade.ts`, after `createBackingTrackPlayer()` (and add
`import type { PlayerMode } from '@coderline/alphatab/PlayerSettings';` to its imports):

```ts
    /**
     * Tells the UI layer to create a player that runs the synthesizer along a backing track or external media
     * ({@link PlayerSettings.enableSynthesizerWithMedia}).
     * @param mode {@link PlayerMode.EnabledBackingTrack} or {@link PlayerMode.EnabledExternalMedia}.
     * @returns The player, or null when this platform can't mix (the media then plays alone).
     */
    createMediaSynthPlayer(mode: PlayerMode): IAlphaSynth | null;
```

`TestUiFacade.ts` (and the same `PlayerMode` import):

```ts
    public createMediaSynthPlayer(_mode: PlayerMode): IAlphaSynth | null {
        return null;
    }
```

Imports: `PlayerMode` (next to `PlayerOutputMode`), `ExternalMediaPlayer`, `WebAudioMixGraph`,
`MediaSynthPlayer, MediaSynthPlayerParts`, `BackingTrackMediaClock, AudioElementClockSource, ExternalMediaClock`,
`MediaLatencyProbe`, `MediaSyncLearnedValues`, `BrowserMediaTimer`; `AlphaSynthAudioWorkletOutput`,
`AlphaSynthWebWorkerApi`, `AudioElementBackingTrackSynthOutput` and `BackingTrackPlayer` are imported already. Remove
nothing else.

- [ ] **Step 7: Run the tests to see them pass**

Run: `npx vitest run test/audio/MediaSynthWiring.test.ts`
Expected: PASS (8 tests).

- [ ] **Step 8: Run the repo gates, build, and commit**

```bash
npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm test
npm run build
git add packages/alphatab/src packages/alphatab/test/audio/MediaSynthWiring.test.ts packages/alphatab/test/visualTests/TestUiFacade.ts
git commit -m "feat: enableSynthesizerWithMedia and mediaSyncOffsetInMilliseconds; create the combined player (#2397)"
git push
```

`npm run build` must pass: it bundles the worklet module too, and Task 12 registered the probe tap in it.

## Phase 5 — Verification

### Task 21: The sync lab (playground demo), with the speed-change tests (F-9d) and the F-3 tolerance

**Files:**
- Create: `packages/playground/demos/sync-lab/index.html`
- Create: `packages/playground/demos/sync-lab/index.ts`
- Modify: `packages/playground/tsconfig.json` and `packages/playground/biome.jsonc` (the playground's typecheck and
  lint cover the lab)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `MediaSynthPlayer.diagnostics` and `controller` (Task 15), `MediaLatencyProbe` (Task 12),
  `MediaSyncConstants` (Task 9), the public API.
- Produces (used by Tasks 22–24): `http://localhost:5188/demos/sync-lab/` with `window.syncLab` (the tests below,
  `results`, `created`), and page controls for a run without a console (Task 24): a count-in box, **Start test**,
  **Loop test**, **Count-in test**, **Seek test** and **Speed-change test** buttons, a `tappedStart` report after a
  tapped Play, and alphaTab's warnings in the page's log.

§9: the spike's measurement page, cleaned up and moved onto the real player. It doesn't carry the spike's modes.
It reads the player through the `@internal` diagnostics only (§3). The default file is the repo's
`syncpoints-testfile.gp` (the spike used a local file). `?file=` loads another one, and `?mixing=0` is the S7 check.
New compared with the spike:

- the real count-in;
- seeks and speed changes during playback on a beat (S4b), and a full-song click count (S5);
- the F-9d tests: an auto-BPM loop, a held sweep, a first Play at an unprobed speed;
- a probe value landing mid-playback (D-1);
- the count-in pre-roll comparison (D-3);
- the 1 s vs 4 s probe comparison (§6.4);
- the S4 tolerance derived from `baseLatency` (F-3).

- [ ] **Step 1: The page**

//   src=beeps  the file's backing track is replaced by a 2 kHz beep on every beat (from the file's own sync points);
//              the synth plays the metronome. Two taps record every beep (media) and every click (synth) on the
//              AudioContext's clock, so click - beep is the audible offset.
//   mixing=0   the S7 check: the same page with enableSynthesizerWithMedia off.

//              context resamples it, as it does a real song (Task 22 Step 1).

    const mean = offsets.length ? Math.round(offsets.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / offsets.length) : 0;
    liveEl.textContent = `live @${speed}x: click - beep (last ${offsets.length}): ${offsets.join(' ')} ms, mean ${mean} ms; ${probe}`;
}, 400);

(window as unknown as { syncLab: unknown }).syncLab = {
    results,
    created,
    lab,
    mediaSynth,
    runMeasurement,
    startTest,
    midPlaybackTest,
    fullSongTest,
    countInTest,
    countInPreRollTest,
    loopTest,
    sweepTest,
    autoBpmLoopTest,
    firstPlayAtUnprobedSpeedTest,

};

(async () => {
    const bytes = new Uint8Array(await (await fetch(file)).arrayBuffer());
    await loadBytes(bytes, file.split('/').pop() ?? file);
})();
```

Note on the beat times: the lab reads the metronome events' **ticks** and maps them with `mainTickToMediaTime`
(Task 2). The spike page passed the events' times to `mainTimePositionToBackingTrack`, which equals this only at 1×.

- [ ] **Step 3: Typecheck, lint, and a smoke run**

The playground's typecheck and lint skip `demos/` (its tsconfig inherits the base's include list: `*.ts`, `src`,
`test`, `scripts`; its `biome.jsonc` lists `*.ts`, `src/**`, `test/**`), so add the lab to both. Replace
`packages/playground/tsconfig.json` with:

```jsonc
{
    "extends": "../../tsconfig.base.json",
    // the base's list plus the sync lab; the other demos stay out (test-results uses Vite's import.meta.hot)
    "include": [
        "${configDir}/*.ts",
        "${configDir}/src",
        "${configDir}/test",
        "${configDir}/scripts",
        "${configDir}/demos/sync-lab"
    ]
}
```

and add `"demos/sync-lab/**"` to the three `includes` lists in `packages/playground/biome.jsonc`. Then:

```bash
npm run typecheck --workspace=packages/playground
npm run lint --workspace=packages/playground
npm run dev --workspace=packages/playground -- --port 5188 --strictPort
```

Open `http://localhost:5188/demos/sync-lab/`, click the page once, wait for "player ready", then in the console
run `await syncLab.startTest(2, 30, 1)` and `await syncLab.midPlaybackTest(1, 30, 'seek', 1)`.
Expected: three rows, `skipped: false`, first clicks within ±11 ms. Reload, tick **count-in** and tap
**Play / Pause**: the log shows a `tappedStart` row with `mediaStartedAfterMs` about one bar. Then open
`http://localhost:5188/demos/sync-lab/?mixing=0`: the log shows `created: {"synthWorkers":0,"synthWorklets":0}`
(S7).

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add packages/playground/demos/sync-lab packages/playground/tsconfig.json packages/playground/biome.jsonc
git commit -m "test(playground): sync lab for synth-with-media acceptance (#2397)"
git push
```

**Interfaces:** consumes the sync lab (Task 21) and the built feature (Tasks 2–20).

The §9 acceptance on Chromium (macOS), with the lab and by ear. Each step names the criterion it measures. Results
go in the dated `.md`: one table per criterion, with the target, the result, pass or fail. Each decision gate
first runs its measurement, then puts the choice as a picker (see "How to run this plan").

- [ ] **Step 1: S1–S3, steady playback**

Run `await syncLab.runMeasurement()`. Pass, on each segment's `settled.p95AbsMs`: S1 ≤ 3 ms ('start@0s 1.0x' and
'seek 1.0x'), S2 ≤ 5 ms ('seek + 1.5x'; also run `syncLab.loopTest(1.25, 4, 3)` for a 1.25× figure), S3 ≤ 20 ms
('seek + 0.5x' and 'seek + 0.75x').

Then reload the lab with `?rate=44100` and run `await syncLab.runMeasurement()` again. The default beep track is a
48 kHz WAV, like the probe's, but most recordings are 44.1 kHz (Guitar Pro audio tracks, MP3s), and a 48 kHz context
resamples them. With the probe's method, the plan review measured that path about 1.3 ms later at 1× (Chromium 152,
macOS). Record these rows beside the 48 kHz ones, with the same targets: they are reported, not gated.

- [ ] **Step 2: S4, S4b, S5 — starts, seeks and speed changes on a beat**

S4 and S5, 15 start cycles per speed:

```text
await syncLab.startTest(15, 30, 1); await syncLab.startTest(15, 30, 0.5); await syncLab.startTest(15, 30, 1.5)
await syncLab.startTest(15, 0, 1)        (exactly on a beat)
```

S4b, seeks and speed changes during playback, 30 ms before a beat:

```text
await syncLab.midPlaybackTest(10, 30, 'seek', 1); await syncLab.midPlaybackTest(10, 30, 'seek', 0.5)
await syncLab.midPlaybackTest(10, 30, 'seek', 1.5)
await syncLab.midPlaybackTest(10, 30, 'speed', 0.75, 1); await syncLab.midPlaybackTest(10, 30, 'speed', 1, 0.75)
await syncLab.midPlaybackTest(10, 30, 'speed', 1.5, 1)
```

S5, a full song: `await syncLab.fullSongTest(1)`.

Pass:
- S4: every `startTest` row has `skipped: false` and `withinTolerance: true` (S4's limits: ±11 ms at 1×, ±25 ms
  below 1×, ±20 ms above).
- S4b: every `midPlaybackTest` row has `skipped: false` and `withinTolerance: true`. Spike 11 saw the media land
  15–43 ms behind right after each speed change: record what this run sees; don't tune the test to pass.
- S5: every `startTest` row's `counts` match (15/15 start cycles at each speed), and `fullSongTest` reads
  `finished: true`, `missing: 0` and `extra: 0`.

§9 also asks for speeds outside the probed list. Run:

```text
await syncLab.startTest(5, 30, 0.25); await syncLab.startTest(5, 30, 2)
await syncLab.lab().measureLatency(0.25); await syncLab.lab().measureLatency(2)
```

Record the click offsets and the measured latencies next to spike 5's (0.25×: 80 ms, 2×: −6 ms). These speeds are
reported, not gated. Below 0.5× no criterion applies (spec §1 stops at 0.5×), yet both apps go down to alphaTab's
0.125× floor and the rhythm game's auto-BPM can start there. The re-sync limits and the nudge work in media ms, so
what you hear loosens as 1 ÷ speed: at 0.25× an offset under 60 ms is never re-synced, and the nudge takes up to
about 35 s to close it. Also run `await syncLab.autoBpmLoopTest(0.25, 5, 10)` (0.25× up to about 0.67×) and record
its first beats and re-syncs, reported, not gated.

- [ ] **Step 3: S4 — the first Play at a speed with no learned start lead (Q-1, D-4: reported, not gated)**

D-4 was settled in the plan review: these starts are reported against S4, not gated. On a fresh page load, click
the page once and wait until `syncLab.lab().probeLatencies` lists 1, 0.5, 0.75, 1.25 and 1.5. Then:

```text
await syncLab.startTest(1, 30, 0.5)
await syncLab.startTest(2, 30, 0.5)
await syncLab.startTest(2, 30, 0.75)
await syncLab.startTest(2, 30, 1)
await syncLab.firstPlayAtUnprobedSpeedTest([0.625, 0.875])
```

The first line is the page's first Play, with nothing learned (learned values live in memory only): report it on
its own (spike 4: 0.5× −29.6 ms; spike 12: −24.7 ms and one re-sync). The next three lines learn the start leads
at 0.5×, 0.75× and 1×, so the last line measures the straight-line guess between learned speeds (spike 11 §2:
0.875× within 5 ms, 0.625× +18…+23 ms; spike 12: 19 of 21 within ±20 ms). Record both next to S4; neither gates
it.

- [ ] **Step 4: STOP — decision gates D-3 (F-14) and S6, the count-in**

```text
await syncLab.countInPreRollTest(0.5, 6)
await syncLab.countInTest(6, 1); await syncLab.countInTest(6, 1.5)
```

Then listen once with the implemented 120 ms, on a real song (`?file=`, as for S11): **Audio** on the file's audio,
count-in on, 0.5×, Play from the first beat after a fill or a crash. By Task 10's start model the recording plays
about 180 ms of the bar before the downbeat under the count-in's last beat (about 60 ms with Option 2). Note what you
hear next to both options.

Put D-3 to the person as `[Q-D3]` with the two pre-roll results and that note in hand:

- **Scenario:** in the rhythm game at 0.5×, you press Play with the count-in on; the backing track enters on the
  downbeat after one bar of clicks.
- **Option 1 (recommended; implemented; spiked in spike 6 with an emulated count-in; Medium):** 120 ms.
- **Option 2 (spiked; Medium):** 60 ms, the same pre-roll as every other start.

Then restate §1 S6's figures with the run's numbers. The 1.5× figure should read 0…+2.7 ms (F-14). Mark "the first
count-in at an unlearned speed: (open)".

If Option 2: set `MediaSyncConstants.CountInPreRollBelow1xMs` to 60, update the tests that pin 120 (Task 10
`pre-roll-rules`; Task 17 `below-1x-the-media-pre-rolls-120-ms`, renamed `below-1x-the-media-pre-rolls-60-ms`, and
`a-speed-change-during-the-count-in-hands-off-at-the-new-speed`: the media at 5000 − 60, `play()` 120 ms before the
boundary; Task 17 `a-count-in-below-1x-pre-rolls-into-a-lead-in`: the media's last seek at 2000 − 60 = 1940, the
synth's seek still at 2000, and its comment says 60 ms), run the repo gates, and commit and push it separately
from the docs.

- [ ] **Step 5: STOP — decision gate D-5 (F-15), S10, the loop wrap**

```text
await syncLab.loopTest(0.5); await syncLab.loopTest(1); await syncLab.loopTest(1.5)
```

Then switch **Audio** to the file's audio, turn the synth tracks on, loop at 1× and 1.5×, and listen at each wrap
the run's `gaps` flags. Loop at 0.5× too and listen at every wrap: nothing of the bar after the range (its downbeat,
its click) may sound before the jump back. The lab's checks can't hear that: the stray beep and its click pair up.
At 0.5× every pass also starts about 60 ms early (the 60 ms pre-roll): on a real song (`?file=`), loop a range that
starts after a fill or a crash, and note in S10's result what of that bar you hear.
Put to the person as `[Q-D5]`:

- **Scenario:** in notation-hero you loop two bars to practice; at every wrap the recording jumps back to the
  first beat.
- **Option 1 (recommended; provisional; partly spiked in spike 4; Medium):** a median gate (median added time per
  wrap ≤ 30 ms, every first beat within S4b: each loop test row's `firstBeatsWithinTolerance`), plus the ear check.
- **Option 2 (spike 4; Medium):** every wrap ≤ 30 ms. A single slow seek fails it.

Write the gate into §1 S10.

- [ ] **Step 6: F-9d — the apps' speed patterns, and S12 into the spec**

```text
await syncLab.sweepTest(1, 12, -0.0072, 250)       (a held tempo button: 12 steps of about 1 BPM)
await syncLab.sweepTest(0.75, 12, 0.0072, 250)
await syncLab.autoBpmLoopTest(0.8, 5, 10)          (the rhythm game: +5 BPM per passed loop)
```

Then the cause of each step's re-sync, as a decision gate (STOP — decision gate D-9):

```text
await syncLab.sweepTest(1, 12, -0.0072, 250, true)     (settle only: no forced re-sync)
```

Each step row has `seekBackMs` (how far the media player's own seek moved the recording back) and `firstDriftMs` (how
far behind the synth the media then was). Put to the person as `[Q-D9]`:

- **Scenario:** in notation-hero you hold the tempo button; at every 1-BPM step the recording jumps back a sliver and
  the synth's notes are cut by a re-sync.
- **Option 1 (implemented; spike 11; High):** keep the media player's seek and one re-sync per step (S12 below).
- **Option 2 (Node-spiked only; Medium):** while mixing, change the media's speed without that seek (as G-1 does
  for the synth) and let a step settle instead of re-syncing. Recommended only if `firstDriftMs − seekBackMs` stays
  within the 15 ms settle threshold at every step (the seek is the cause).

If Option 2: `BackingTrackPlayer` gets an internal `keepsPositionOnSpeedChange` that the combined player sets while
mixing, `MediaSyncController.speedChanged()` settles without its forced re-sync (the drift rules still re-sync above
the threshold), Task 9's `speed-change-re-syncs-and-settles` and Task 16's `a-speed-change-while-playing-re-syncs`
follow, spec §4 and §6.2 get the carve-out, and S12 below says "settles" instead of "one re-sync per step". The
other places that expect a re-sync at each speed change follow too: Step 7's Option 2 (it re-syncs "as
`speedChanged()` does"), Step 9's listening check, the listening checks in spec §9 and Task 24 (Steps 2 and 5)
where they name that re-sync, spec §12's tempo-sweep reason and §14's sweep line, and the code comments that
say so (in `speedChanged()`, the speed setter and Task 16's `the-same-speed-again-changes-nothing`). Run the
repo gates, and commit and push it separately from the docs.

Add S12 to §1, with the numbers this run measured:

**After** (a new row under S11):
> S12 | Speed changes during playback (the apps' patterns) | a held sweep in 1-BPM steps every 250 ms: one
> re-sync per step (Chrome's media lands 15–43 ms behind at each change, spike 11), clicks back within S4b's
> tolerance 1.5 s after the last step; an auto-BPM loop (+5 BPM per wrap, 10 wraps): no missing clicks (so no
> skipped first beat); each repetition's first beat is reported, not gated, because every wrap restarts at a speed
> with no learned start lead (as S4, Q-1); the first Play at an unprobed speed: as S4 (reported, not gated)

- [ ] **Step 7: STOP — decision gate D-1 (F-9a), a probe value mid-playback**

```text
await syncLab.probeMidPlaybackTest(0.875, false); await syncLab.probeMidPlaybackTest(0.875, true)
```

with the synth tracks unmuted and listening, then the same pair at 0.625×. Put to the person as `[Q-D1]`:

- **Scenario:** in the rhythm game the auto-BPM moves to a speed never played before, and its latency measurement
  lands two bars in.
- **Option 1 (recommended; implemented; not spiked before this run; Low → as measured):** settle only; the drift
  rules re-sync only if the agreed drift exceeds the threshold.
- **Option 2 (the spec's current §6.4 text):** re-sync on arrival. It cuts the notes that are sounding (spike 4).

A value measured at another speed can also move the playing speed's straight-line guess mid-playback: after an early
Play at 0.875×, with only 1× measured and 0.5× being measured, the clock steps 13.1 ms of media time when 0.5× lands
(15 ms heard, inside S4's ±25 ms below 1×), and only the nudge closes it, in about 6 s. The answer also says whether
that case gets the same rule as the playing speed's own value; if it does, Task 15's `_onProbed` calls
`latencyChanged()` whenever the playing speed's latency changes, with a Transport test, the repo gates, and a commit
and push separate from the docs.

Edit §6.4's sentence "A value that arrives during playback is applied like a speed change (re-sync, settle)" to
match the answer.

If Option 2: make `MediaSyncController.latencyChanged()` re-sync, as `speedChanged()` does; update Task 10's
`latency-change-settles-without-resync` and Task 16's `a-probe-value-during-playback-settles` to expect one
re-sync; run the repo gates; and commit and push it separately from the docs.

- [ ] **Step 8: §6.4 — the shorter probe**

Run `await syncLab.probeComparison()`. If the 1 s and 4 s values differ by more than 3 ms at any speed, change
`MediaLatencyProbe.LengthS` / `SpacingS` to 4 / 0.25. Task 12's time-limit test
(`a-measurement-that-never-loads-gives-up-after-its-time-limit`) assumes the 1 s probe: a 4 s probe at 0.5× gives up
after 4000 / 0.5 + 2000 = 10000 ms, so that test then advances `4000 / 0.5 + 2000 - 1` ms and expects
`'no result within 10000 ms'`. Run the repo gates, commit and push it separately, and say so in the results. Either
way, remove "**untested**" from §6.4 and state what was measured.

- [ ] **Step 9: S7, S8, S11, F-8, F-13 and by ear**

- **S7:** with `?mixing=0` the log shows 0 synth workers and 0 synth worklets.
- **S8:** play the same song for 30 s in synth mode (the control demo) and with mixing on (this lab, the file's
  audio). Record main-thread scripting time and worker message counts from the Chrome performance panel. They
  should be comparable.
- **S11 and F-13:** play a mastered recording (`?file=` your real MP3-backed file) at default levels — the
  metronome must be clearly audible. Then raise `synthVolume` to 3 — there must be no clipping by ear. Also re-run
  spike 8's offline script (`docs/spikes/issue-2397/spike-8-limiter-console.js`): its proposed row must still read
  −0.31 dBFS at `synthVolume` 3 (the unit test ties the code's values to it).
- **F-8 signals:** re-run `docs/spikes/issue-2397/spike-10-batch-1-console.js` in the control demo: a SoundFont
  download failure now fires `soundFontLoadFailed` on the player instance. Mixing on with a missing worker or
  worklet plays the media alone, with the warning.
- **Learned values across a player recreation:** in the lab, switch the player away and back from the console, as
  the rhythm game's Synth and Audio buttons do: `api.settings.player.playerMode = 2; api.updateSettings();` then
  `api.settings.player.playerMode = 3; api.updateSettings();` (2 = `EnabledSynthesizer`, 3 = `EnabledBackingTrack`).
  Once the log shows "player ready" again, `syncLab.lab().startLeads` still lists the speeds learned in Step 3: a
  recreated player keeps what the page learned (in memory only). The lab's taps stay on the first player: reload the
  page before measuring again.
- **Listening check (§9):** the file's audio with the synth tracks unmuted, using a song with sustained notes.
  Do a Play, a seek, and a speed change. Expect no cut notes and no dropouts, except the one re-sync at each speed
  change (spike 11; a re-sync that keeps notes sounding is later work, §12).
- **Manual (§9):** your real MP3 with drums and metronome, by ear. The `youtube-sync` playground demo with mixing
  on and the metronome: tune `mediaSyncOffsetInMilliseconds` by ear and record the value (S9). The demo has no
  mixing switch, so turn it on from the console once the video is ready, before Play. The demo attached its YouTube
  handler to the first player only, so carry it over:

  ```js
  const handler = api.player.output.handler;
  api.settings.player.enableSynthesizerWithMedia = true;
  api.updateSettings(); // recreates the player (Task 20)
  api.player.output.handler = handler;
  ```

  Then turn the metronome on and tune with `api.settings.player.mediaSyncOffsetInMilliseconds = <ms>` (read live: no
  `updateSettings()` needed). With that offset set and the count-in off, start the video three times with
  `api.play()` at 1× (pause in between), then read `api.player.instance.controller.startLeads.toRecord()` and record
  the 1× value in the dated acceptance `.md`. YouTube's start lead includes the offset (a positive offset lowers it by
  as much), and the lead stops at −50 ms (G-4): at −50, every Play without a count-in starts the synth ahead of the
  video and re-syncs once. If it reads −50, the floor needs a decision before Task 26 ships the offset.

- [ ] **Step 10: F-18 — the acceptance list**

In §9's sync-lab row, change "Acceptance: S1–S5, S4b, S10" to "Acceptance: S1–S6 (S6: backing track), S4b, S10,
S12", using D-3's and D-4's answers.

- [ ] **Step 11: Commit the evidence and the spec**

```bash
git add docs/spikes/issue-2397 docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-07-synth-with-media-design.md
git commit -m "docs: #2397 acceptance run (Chromium/macOS); S6, S10, S12 and §6.4 settled"
git push
```

### Task 23: A run on a machine with a higher `baseLatency` — decision gate D-2 (F-3)

**Files:**
- Create: `docs/spikes/issue-2397/baselatency-<date>.md`
- Modify: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-07-synth-with-media-design.md` (§14 F-3: the D-2 answer)
- Modify: `packages/alphatab/src/platform/javascript/MediaSyncController.ts` (`settleThreshold`'s comment: the D-2
  answer; with Option 2 also its rule)
- Modify (only if D-2 Option 2 is picked): `packages/alphatab/test/audio/MediaSyncController.test.ts`
  (`settle-threshold-at-1x-grows-with-the-base-latency`), `packages/playground/demos/sync-lab/index.ts`
  (`firstClickToleranceMs`)

**Interfaces:** consumes the sync lab.

F-3 (both; our design's problem; not spiked; Low): the thresholds come from the context's audio callback. Settle
re-sync at 1× = max(12 ms, 2 × `baseLatency` + 1 ms); the first-click tolerance = max(±11 ms, ±2 × `baseLatency`).
Every run so far was on Chrome/macOS (`baseLatency` ≤ 5.3 ms), where both equal today's constants. WebKit (the
iPad) reports `baseLatency` as one 128-frame render quantum (2.7 ms at 48 kHz) whatever the device's audio path,
so there both stay at today's constants: its `toleranceMs` always reads 11, and it can't stand in for this gate.

- [ ] **Step 1: Find the machine**

Windows Chrome typically reports 10 ms. In the lab's console, `syncLab.lab().audioContext.baseLatency * 1000`
must be above 5.3. Note the browser, OS and value.

No such machine at hand: run Task 24 and let its devices stand in. Each device's 1× **Start test** row prints
`toleranceMs`; above 11 means a `baseLatency` above 5.5 ms (the value is `toleranceMs` / 2), where the derived values
first differ from today's. If a device reads above 11, its 1× Start test and Loop test rows are Step 2's run: put
D-2 to the person (Step 3, naming that device in the scenario) before Task 24 Step 5. If D-2 then switches to
Option 2, rebuild and re-run that device's 1× Start test and Loop test before Step 5. If no device reads above 11,
D-2 keeps the derived default (it equals today's values there), the dated `.md` and spec §14 say F-3 is untested
above 5.5 ms, and delivery (Tasks 25–27) doesn't wait for it.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the start and loop tests**

```text
await syncLab.startTest(10, 30, 1); await syncLab.startTest(10, 0, 1); await syncLab.loopTest(1)
```

Record each start test's `toleranceMs` and its rows' `withinTolerance`, `resyncs` and `lockMs`; from the loop test,
`toleranceMs`, `firstBeatsMs`, `firstBeatsWithinTolerance` and `resyncs`.

- [ ] **Step 3: STOP — decision gate D-2**

Put to the person as `[Q-D2]`, with the numbers:

- **Scenario:** you play on a Windows laptop whose audio callback is 10 ms. Should a 15 ms start offset re-sync
  (cutting notes) or be nudged away?
- **Option 1 (implemented; now measured):** keep the derived thresholds.
- **Option 2:** go back to the fixed 12 ms / ±11 ms.

Record the answer in §14 and in `MediaSyncController.settleThreshold`'s comment.

If Option 2: `settleThreshold` returns `MediaSyncConstants.SettleResyncThresholdAt1xMs` at 1×, the lab's
`firstClickToleranceMs` returns 11 at 1×, and Task 9's `settle-threshold-at-1x-grows-with-the-base-latency`
expects 12 at any `baseLatency`. Either way, run the repo gates (and the playground typecheck), then commit and
push the `MediaSyncController.ts` change (with Option 2's code and test) separately from the docs.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add docs/spikes/issue-2397/baselatency-*.md docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-07-synth-with-media-design.md
git commit -m "docs: #2397 baseLatency run (F-3, D-2)"
git push
```

### Task 24: Target devices — iPad (WebKit) and Android — decision gates D-7 (R-2) and D-8 (R-1)

**Files:**
- Create: `docs/spikes/issue-2397/target-devices-<date>.md`
- Modify (only if D-7 Option 1 or 2, or D-8 Option 1, is picked):
  `packages/alphatab/src/platform/javascript/MediaSynthPlayer.ts`,
  `packages/alphatab/src/platform/javascript/MediaLatencyProbe.ts` (D-7 Option 1, when Step 2 found no probe values),
  `packages/alphatab/test/audio/MediaSynthPlayer.CountIn.test.ts` (D-7),
  `packages/alphatab/test/audio/MediaSynthPlayer.Routing.test.ts` (D-8)

**Interfaces:** consumes the sync lab, served over HTTPS.

§9's target-device row: before delivery, run the sync lab's start, loop and count-in tests and the listening check
on two devices. One is an iPad (WebKit, inside the Web MIDI Browser shim app both apps use there); the other is an
Android tablet (Chrome). Load the lab over HTTPS: AudioWorklets need a secure context. A device that misses the
targets or fails the listening check goes to the person (D-10), who keeps it media-only in both apps until it
passes (each app leaves the flag off there) or keeps mixing on with the miss written down: Step 5 writes that
down as a platform rule, and Tasks 26 and 27 apply it.

- [ ] **Step 1: Serve the lab over HTTPS on the local network**

Use a tunnel or a local certificate so both devices load `https://…/demos/sync-lab/`. First check that mixing
runs at all: the log must not show "playing the media only".

- [ ] **Step 2: The runs on each device**

First, before anything plays on that page, a tapped start (D-7's case). WebKit lets an element play without a gesture
once it has played from one, so a refused delayed `play()` only shows on a fresh page. Load the lab, wait for "player
ready", tick **count-in**, keep **Speed** at 1 and tap **Play / Pause** once. The log prints a `tappedStart` row (did
the media start, and how long after the tap) and any player warning, such as "The media did not start". Reload, untick **count-in**, set **Speed** to 0.75 and tap **Play / Pause** once (a start below 1× seeks the
media and plays it after the seek, also outside the tap). Record both rows. Then copy
`syncLab.lab().probeLatencies` and any "Measuring the media latency" warning from the log: a speed missing from
the list is one the probe could not measure on this device (its hidden `<audio>` was refused or never loaded, or its
tap heard no beeps: "no beeps heard"), not a sync miss.

Then the measured runs, with the page's **Start test**, **Loop test**, **Count-in test**, **Seek test** and
**Speed-change test** buttons (**Speed** sets the speed; the rows print in the log), or from the console where there is
one:

```text
await syncLab.startTest(10, 30, 1); await syncLab.startTest(10, 30, 0.5)
await syncLab.loopTest(1); await syncLab.countInTest(6, 1)
await syncLab.midPlaybackTest(10, 30, 'seek', 1); await syncLab.midPlaybackTest(10, 30, 'speed', 0.75, 1)
```

Run **Seek test** and **Speed-change test** at 1× and at 0.5×: they are S4b, which spec §9 asks of the devices too.

Then do the listening check: the file's audio, synth tracks on; Play, a seek, a speed change. Listen for cut notes
and dropouts beyond the one re-sync at each speed change (Task 22 Step 9 expects that one). Put the results beside
the §1 targets in the dated `.md`: what was heard, in the recording or the synth tracks, and after which action.

- [ ] **Step 3: STOP — decision gate D-8 (R-1), iOS's Ring/Silent switch**

On the iPad, turn the Silent switch on and play. Is the backing track still heard? (Web Audio is muted in silent
mode; a plain `<audio>` is not.) If it isn't heard, reload the lab with `?audioSession=playback` (it sets
`navigator.audioSession.type = 'playback'`, Safari 16.4+, before any Play) and listen again. Put to the person as `[Q-D8]`:

- **Scenario:** a student practices on an iPad with the Silent switch on; with mixing, the recording falls silent.
- **Option 1:** set `navigator.audioSession.type = 'playback'` while mixing on iOS (a small change in
  `MediaSynthPlayer`, with a test).
- **Option 2:** leave mixing off on iOS (both apps keep the flag off there).
- **Option 3:** document it and leave it to the apps.

Confidence and spiked status come from this run.

If Option 1: make the change in `MediaSynthPlayer`, add its test to `MediaSynthPlayer.Routing.test.ts`, run the
repo gates, and commit and push it separately from the docs.

- [ ] **Step 4: STOP — decision gate D-7 (R-2), a refused delayed `play()`**

On the iPad, use Step 2's two tapped rows: they are the only starts on a fresh page, and a later `countInTest` or
`startTest` can't show a refusal (by then the backing track has played from a gesture). Did WebKit refuse the backing
track's `play()` a bar after the tap (count-in), or after the pre-roll seek (0.75×)? A refusal shows as
`mediaStartedAfterMs: null`, and the safety net (Task 17) pauses both and logs "The media did not start" on the page.
Put to the person as `[Q-D7]`, with the result:

- **Scenario:** in the rhythm game on the iPad you press Play with the count-in on, or at a practice speed such as
  0.75×; WebKit refuses the backing track's later `play()`, so playback pauses with a warning instead of starting.
- **Option 1:** unlock the media in the gesture: call the `<audio>`'s `play()` and `pause()` synchronously inside
  the Play handler, so a later `play()` is allowed (a change in `MediaSynthPlayer.play()`, for every app Play: the
  count-in hand-off, the pre-roll seek away from 1× and a learned media delay all call `play()` after the gesture;
  with a test). If Step 2 found no probe values, Option 1 also unlocks the probe: one probe `<audio>` per player,
  unlocked the same way in the first Play and reused for every measurement (untested).
- **Option 2:** no count-in on WebKit: start the media at once and skip the count-in there (starts away from 1×
  still call `play()` after the pre-roll seek).
- **Option 3:** keep the safety net only.

If it is not refused, record that and keep the safety net.

If Option 1 or 2: make the change in `MediaSynthPlayer` (Option 1: `play()`; Option 2: the count-in branch of
`_startPlayback`), add its test to `MediaSynthPlayer.CountIn.test.ts`, run the repo gates, and commit and push
it separately from the docs.

- [ ] **Step 5: The platform rule (Tasks 26 and 27 copy it)**

End the dated `.md` with a **Platform rule** table: one row per platform class, how the apps detect it, the runs
that cover it, and the flag. A class that D-8 left media-only gets "off". A class that missed a §1 target, or
whose listening check heard dropouts or cut notes beyond the one re-sync at each speed change, is decision gate
D-10 (STOP): put it to the person as `[Q-D10]`, with the miss (by how many ms, or what was heard and after which
action) and whether a listener hears it. **Option 1 (the default):** "off" until it passes again.
**Option 2:** "on", with the miss written in that class's row.

| Class | Detected by | Runs | Flag |
|---|---|---|---|
| Chromium on a desktop | `Chrome/` in the user agent, no `Android` | Task 22, and Task 23 if a machine was found | on, unless D-10 turned it off (a missed §1 target, or Task 22 Step 9's listening check) |
| Android Chrome | `Chrome/` and `Android` in the user agent | this task | on, unless D-10 turned it off |
| iOS and iPadOS (WebKit: every browser there) | the rhythm game's `isIOS()` | this task, D-7, D-8 | on, unless D-10 turned it off or D-8 left mixing off on iOS |
| Every other browser (desktop Safari, desktop Firefox) | none of the above | none | on (chosen in the plan review: reach over a run; spec §13's manual checks are still owed) |

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add docs/spikes/issue-2397/target-devices-*.md
git commit -m "docs: #2397 target-device run (iPad WebKit, Android Chrome; R-1, R-2)"
git push
```

---

## Phase 6 — Delivery (§11)

These tasks work in the two app repositories, alphaTabWebsite and notation-hero. Use each repo's own branch, commit
and test conventions, never their default branch. Commands below use repo-relative paths, plus shell variables you
set yourself (never write absolute paths into tracked files).

### Task 25: Build, pack, and a first try in both apps (a `file:` dependency)

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/spikes/issue-2397/target-devices-<date>.md` (Task 24's dated `.md`: Step 2's YouTube start answers)
- Nothing else tracked: a tarball outside both apps.

- [ ] **Step 1: Build and pack**

From the alphaTab feature worktree, with everything committed (`git status --short` prints nothing):

```bash
npm run build-web
npm pack --workspace=packages/alphatab
git checkout -- packages/alphatab/package.json
git status --short
```

`npm run build-web` builds alphaTab and its webpack and Vite plugins, as the publish workflow does
(`.github/workflows/~publish_web.yml`). The pack step's `prepack` script copies both plugin builds into the package
and fails without them. It also rewrites the tracked `packages/alphatab/package.json` from `"type": "module"` to
`"commonjs"`, and nothing puts it back, so the `git checkout` restores that one file (here in the alphaTab worktree;
Step 2's rule is for the app checkouts). The last `git status --short` must print nothing (the tarball is
git-ignored): with that file rewritten, the repo's tests don't load and Task 26 Step 4's rebase refuses to start.

Expected: a `coderline-alphatab-<version>.tgz` in the worktree root. Set `ALPHATAB_PACK` in your shell to its
absolute path.

- [ ] **Step 2: Try it in alphaTabWebsite (a new branch in a throwaway worktree, not committed)**

```bash
git fetch origin
git worktree add ../alphaTabWebsite-try-2397 -b try/2397-synth-with-media origin/rhythm-game
cd ../alphaTabWebsite-try-2397
npm ci
npm install "$ALPHATAB_PACK"
```

Run these from the alphaTabWebsite checkout. The try gets a new branch in its own worktree, so your checkout and
any uncommitted work in it are never touched. Never run `git restore`, `git checkout .`, `git stash`,
`git reset --hard` or `git clean` in an app checkout.

Turn `player.enableSynthesizerWithMedia` on where the rhythm game creates the API (Task 26 Step 5 shows the change).
Play a backing-track song with the metronome on, by ear, and then the YouTube flow. Then serve this try over
HTTPS to the iPad (as in Task 24 Step 1), in the Web MIDI Browser app. On a fresh load turn the count-in on and tap
Play on a YouTube song: does the video start after the count-in bar? Reload, turn the count-in off, set the speed to
0.75 and tap Play once more: does it start? (Both starts reach YouTube after the tap, as in Task 24 Step 2.) Note
both answers in Task 24's dated `.md`: Task 26 Step 5 hides YouTube's own controls on iOS only if both started
(`YOUTUBE_LATE_START_WORKS_ON_IOS`). If the try can't reach the iPad, count it as not started. Do the same two starts
in Safari on this Mac (a fresh load each; the dev server's `localhost` is a secure context, so mixing is on) and note
them too: Task 26 Step 5 hides YouTube's own controls in desktop Safari only if both started there
(`YOUTUBE_LATE_START_WORKS_ON_DESKTOP_SAFARI`). Then throw the branch away:

```bash
cd -
git worktree remove --force ../alphaTabWebsite-try-2397
git branch -D try/2397-synth-with-media
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Try it in notation-hero/web (a new branch in a throwaway worktree, not committed)**

```bash
git fetch origin
git worktree add ../notation-hero-try-2397 -b try/2397-synth-with-media origin/master
cd ../notation-hero-try-2397
pnpm install
pnpm --filter web add "file:$ALPHATAB_PACK"
```

Run these from the notation-hero checkout. The same rule: the try lives in its own worktree, and nothing touches the
checkout's uncommitted work. Turn the flag on where the app builds its alphaTab settings (Task 27 Step 3 shows
where). notation-hero has no YouTube flow, so check a file with its own recording, by ear, with the metronome on. Its
Metronome button is greyed out for a recording until Task 27, so turn the metronome on from DevTools: select the
notation box and run `$0.at.metronomeVolume = 1` (the app keeps its live api there). Then go back (`cd -`), remove
the worktree (`git worktree remove --force ../notation-hero-try-2397`) and delete the branch.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit the YouTube start answers**

In the alphaTab feature worktree (Step 2 wrote them into Task 24's dated `.md`):

```bash
git add docs/spikes/issue-2397/target-devices-*.md
git commit -m "docs: #2397 YouTube late-start answers (iOS, desktop Safari)"
git push
```

The tree is clean again: Task 26 Step 4's rebase needs that, and so does Step 1 if a try sends you back there.

If either try fails, stop here, fix it on `feat/2397-synth-with-media` (with a test), and come back to Step 1.

---

### Task 26: alphaTabWebsite — the patch (patch-package) and turning the feature on (F-10)

**Files (alphaTabWebsite):** `package.json`, its lockfile, `patches/@coderline+alphatab+<alpha>.patch` (new),
`patches/@coderline+alphatab+1.8.1.patch` (delete), the rhythm game's API settings and YouTube player options,
`cross-markers.tsx`, `src/utils.ts` (`supportsMixing()`, `hideYouTubeControls()`), `src/components/AlphaTabRhythmGame/youtube-player.tsx` (the
volume scale), `src/components/AlphaTabRhythmGame/practice-mode-settings.tsx` (the Practice panel's Metronome and
Count-In sliders), `src/components/AlphaTabRhythmGame/playground-settings.tsx` (the level sliders).

**F-10** (both apps; our design's problem; not spiked; Medium): §11 step 4 turns the feature on in each app. Where mixing
is on, the rhythm game creates its YouTube player with `controls: 0` and `disablekb: 1`, so starts go through the
app's Play button and keep their count-in (§7); elsewhere, and on iOS and desktop Safari unless Task 25 showed that a
late start plays the video there, YouTube keeps its controls.

- [ ] **Step 1: A branch in its own worktree, and the alpha that is current today**

```bash
git fetch origin
git worktree add ../alphaTabWebsite-2397 -b feat/2397-synth-with-media origin/rhythm-game
cd ../alphaTabWebsite-2397
npm ci
npm view @coderline/alphatab dist-tags
```

Run these from the alphaTabWebsite checkout, and every later step in `../alphaTabWebsite-2397`. The branch gets its
own worktree, so Step 6's `git add -A` commits only this task's changes, never uncommitted work in your checkout
(Task 25's rule). Pick the current `1.9.0-alpha.N` and call it `<alpha>` below.

- [ ] **Step 2: Upgrade, and drop the stale patch in the same commit**

```bash
npm install @coderline/alphatab@<alpha>
git rm patches/@coderline+alphatab+1.8.1.patch
```

The 1.8.1 patch is CoderLine/alphaTab#2591 (drum tablature) back-ported and, since 2026-09-28, CoderLine/alphaTab#2894
(horizontal layout width at a display scale above 1). The alpha contains #2591 (checked 2026-10-08 with
`guitar-pro-rock-beat-repeat.gp`). #2894 is in an alpha only if it was built after 2026-10-06 (the newest today,
`1.9.0-alpha.1891`, is from 2026-08-09), but it is in `develop` @ `25ef76d3`, so this task's own patch (Step 4, built from
the feature branch) carries it. A stale patch file fails every install: patch-package exits 1 and
skips every patch after it.

- [ ] **Step 3: The drum marker id after the upgrade**

After the upgrade a hi-hat on string 6 is drawn on the 6th tab line (as in Guitar Pro) instead of line 5. Drum notes
also have `note.fret = NaN`. In `cross-markers.tsx`, build the marker id for drum notes from
`note.percussionArticulation` instead of `note.fret`. Run `npm run typecheck` (the app has no test script) and look
at a drum song.

- [ ] **Step 4: The patch, from an alpha that is an ancestor of the feature branch**

In the alphaTab feature worktree:

```bash
npm view @coderline/alphatab@<alpha> gitHead
git merge-base --is-ancestor <gitHead> HEAD && echo ancestor
```

If it isn't an ancestor: rebase `feat/2397-synth-with-media` onto `develop` at or after `<gitHead>`, run the repo
gates, rebuild (`npm run build`), push. If the rebase brings in CoderLine/alphaTab#2932 (the count-in freeze fix for
the media-only modes, spec §8), expect one conflict in `AlphaSynth.ts`: Task 13's `backingTrackVolume`/`synthVolume`
members and #2932's `supportsCountIn` getter both sit right after `countInVolume`. Keep both.

The rebase also brings two merged changes (both in `develop` by 2026-10-08). Neither conflicts, but each needs one
change:

- CoderLine/alphaTab#2928 adds `test/audio/AlphaSynthWebWorkerApi.test.ts`. Its `TestSynthWorker` has no `'error'`
  overload (Task 5), so `npm run typecheck` fails. Type its `addEventListener` as
  `(_event: 'message' | 'error', _handler: (ev: never) => void)`, as Task 5's `FakeSynthWorker` does.
- CoderLine/alphaTab#2939 counts in one bar plus the beats up to a mid-bar or pick-up start. It ends the count-in
  early by the distance from the start to the next beat. That distance is in the song's milliseconds, but a count-in
  that follows the media plays at the media's tempo (Task 2's `bpmOverride`). In `generateCountInMidi`, keep the tempo
  from before the override (`const songBpm = bpm;`) and scale the distance:
  `const distanceToClick = ((nextClick.time - this._mainState.currentTime) * songBpm) / bpm;`. Add a test to
  `FollowMedia.test.ts`: a 120 BPM score, sync points at 100 BPM, a start half a beat before beat 3. The song's beat 3
  must come 600 ms (one beat at 100 BPM) after the count-in's last click; without the change it comes at 650 ms.
  Then update spec §2's count-in row and S6: one bar, plus the beats up to the start beat.

After the gates, run the sync lab's `await syncLab.countInTest(6, 1)` once on the rebuilt branch (S6, the count-in).
Then copy the build into alphaTabWebsite and create the patch:

```bash
rm -r node_modules/@coderline/alphatab/dist
cp -R "$ALPHATAB_WORKTREE/packages/alphatab/dist" node_modules/@coderline/alphatab/dist
npx patch-package @coderline/alphatab
```

(`ALPHATAB_WORKTREE` is the feature worktree's absolute path in your shell.) Expected:
`patches/@coderline+alphatab+<alpha>.patch`. It only adds this feature, plus any `develop` commits newer than the
alpha.

- [ ] **Step 5: Turn it on (F-10) where Task 24's platform rule allows**

Copy the **Platform rule** table from `docs/spikes/issue-2397/target-devices-<date>.md` (alphaTab, Task 24 Step 5)
into `MIXING_ON` below, and add the helper to `src/utils.ts`, next to `isIOS()`:

```ts
// alphaTab #2397: where the synthesizer plays along backing tracks and YouTube (Task 24's platform rule)
const MIXING_ON = { chromiumDesktop: true, androidChrome: true, iosWebKit: true, other: true };

export function supportsMixing(): boolean {
  // what alphaTab itself needs; without it alphaTab plays the media alone and logs a warning
  if (!window.isSecureContext || !("AudioWorkletNode" in window)) return false;
  if (isIOS()) return MIXING_ON.iosWebKit;
  const ua = navigator.userAgent;
  if (/\bChrome\//.test(ua)) {
    return /\bAndroid\b/.test(ua) ? MIXING_ON.androidChrome : MIXING_ON.chromiumDesktop;
  }
  return MIXING_ON.other; // desktop Safari, desktop Firefox
}
```

Then, where the rhythm game builds its alphaTab settings (the `useAlphaTab` callback in
`src/components/AlphaTabRhythmGame/index.tsx`), next to `s.player.playerMode`:

```ts
s.player.enableSynthesizerWithMedia = supportsMixing();
```

Where it creates the YouTube player (`src/components/AlphaTabRhythmGame/youtube-player.tsx`), hide YouTube's own
controls only where mixing is on, and on WebKit (iOS and desktop Safari) only if Task 25 Step 2's late starts played
the video there. Add `controls?: 0 | 1; disablekb?: 0 | 1;` to the `playerVars` type there (today it lists only
`autoplay`), and this helper to `src/utils.ts`, next to `supportsMixing()`:

```ts
// alphaTab #2397: YouTube's own controls are hidden only where mixing is on (starts then keep their count-in),
// and on WebKit (iOS, desktop Safari) only if a start issued after the tap played the video there (Task 25 Step 2)
const YOUTUBE_LATE_START_WORKS_ON_IOS = false;
const YOUTUBE_LATE_START_WORKS_ON_DESKTOP_SAFARI = false;

function isDesktopSafari(): boolean {
  // Chromium browsers (Chrome, Edge, Opera) name Safari in their user agent too
  const ua = navigator.userAgent;
  return /\bSafari\//.test(ua) && !/\bChrom(e|ium)\//.test(ua);
}

export function hideYouTubeControls(): boolean {
  if (!supportsMixing()) return false;
  if (isIOS()) return YOUTUBE_LATE_START_WORKS_ON_IOS;
  if (isDesktopSafari()) return YOUTUBE_LATE_START_WORKS_ON_DESKTOP_SAFARI;
  return true;
}
```

```ts
playerVars: { autoplay: 0, ...(hideYouTubeControls() ? { controls: 0, disablekb: 1 } : {}) },
```

Where they stay, a start from YouTube's own play button plays without a count-in (F-6), and after a refused start
the video can still be started. Don't overlay the player: YouTube's terms forbid it (§7).

If the game starts alphaTab from YouTube's `PLAYING` event, call
`output.updatePosition(player.getCurrentTime() * 1000)` right before `api.play()` (F-6).

The sync offset is for YouTube only. Both media clocks subtract `mediaSyncOffsetInMilliseconds` (Task 11), and the
backing track was measured in sync without one (Task 22), so set it per media type. In the effect in
`src/components/AlphaTabRhythmGame/index.tsx` that sets `playerMode`, next to that line in each branch, set
`api.settings.player.mediaSyncOffsetInMilliseconds` to the value found by ear in Task 22 Step 9 in the
`MediaType.YouTube` branch (0 if none was needed), and to 0 in the `MediaType.Synth` and `MediaType.Audio` branches.
The clocks read it live, so a song with its own recording never plays with the YouTube value.

**The YouTube wrapper's volume** (a bug in the app today; with mixing on it hits on every switch to YouTube). The
IFrame API's `setVolume`/`getVolume` speak 0–100; alphaTab's `masterVolume` and the wrapper's `HTMLMediaElement`-like
`volume` speak 0–1. In `src/components/AlphaTabRhythmGame/youtube-player.tsx`, scale both ways:

```ts
get volume(): number {
    // the IFrame API speaks 0-100; HTMLMediaElement and alphaTab's masterVolume speak 0-1
    return (iframeApiPlayer.current?.getVolume() ?? 100) / 100;
},
set volume(value: number) {
    if (iframeApiPlayer.current) {
        iframeApiPlayer.current.setVolume(Math.round(Math.min(Math.max(value, 0), 1) * 100));
    }
},
```

Check: in YouTube mode, set the Volume slider to 0.5: the video plays at half volume, not near silence; and with
mixing on, the video keeps its volume once the synthesizer is ready.

**The level sliders** (chosen in the plan review). At the default levels the click sits about 8 dB under a mastered
recording (spike 5), and the game's sliders stop at 1. In `src/components/AlphaTabRhythmGame/playground-settings.tsx`
(the Player group), Metronome and Count-In go to 3, alphaTab's documented range: 2.5 is about +8 dB, and with Sonivox
the click alone peaks at −1.6 dBFS at 3. Two new sliders reach the new levels:

```diff
 {
   label: "Metronome Volume",
   ...factory.apiAccessors("metronomeVolume"),
-  control: { type: "number-range", min: 0, max: 1, step: 0.1 },
+  control: { type: "number-range", min: 0, max: 3, step: 0.1 },
 },
 {
   label: "Count-In Volume",
   ...factory.apiAccessors("countInVolume"),
-  control: { type: "number-range", min: 0, max: 1, step: 0.1 },
+  control: { type: "number-range", min: 0, max: 3, step: 0.1 },
 },
+{
+  label: "Synth Volume (with media)",
+  ...factory.apiAccessors("synthVolume"),
+  control: { type: "number-range", min: 0, max: 3, step: 0.1 },
+},
+{
+  label: "Backing Track Volume",
+  ...factory.apiAccessors("backingTrackVolume"),
+  control: { type: "number-range", min: 0, max: 1, step: 0.1 },
+},
```

The Practice panel (`src/components/AlphaTabRhythmGame/practice-mode-settings.tsx`, its Player Control group) has the
same Metronome and Count-In sliders, also at `max: 1`. Give both `max: 3` the same way (the two `control` lines
above); the two new sliders stay in Settings only. Left at 1, a level above 1 set in Settings shows there as a full
slider, and moving either slider sets the level back to 1 or less. Check: Metronome at 2.5 in Settings, then open
Practice: its Metronome slider sits at 2.5 of 3.

Volume (`masterVolume`) stays at `max: 1`. It also drives YouTube's level, which stops at 100%, so above 1 only the
synthesizer would get louder over a video. Volume and Synth Volume together reach every balance. There is no
YouTube-only slider: alphaTab sets YouTube's level from `masterVolume` (spike 9 §3). Check, with mixing on: Metronome
at 2.5 brings the click level with a mastered backing track, and Backing Track Volume at 0.3 lowers the recording,
not the click.

The transport's Metronome and Count-In buttons stay as they are: they switch between 0 and 1, so a press brings a
raised level back to 1, and at any level other than 1 the Metronome button reads "Enable metronome" (a bug in the
game today). A raised level is set with the sliders.

- [ ] **Step 6: Check, commit, push**

Run the app's checks: `npm run typecheck`, then what its CI runs, `npm run generate-alphatabdoc && npm run build` (the
app has no test or lint script). By ear: a backing-track song with the metronome, a loop, a speed change; the YouTube
flow, with a two-bar YouTube loop and the metronome (each pass starts without its first click, then the clicks rejoin
the video).

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: metronome along backing tracks and YouTube (alphaTab #2397 patch on <alpha>)"
git push -u origin feat/2397-synth-with-media
```

Opening a PR in alphaTabWebsite is your call in that repo. Its PR workflow installs `@coderline/alphatab@alpha` over
the pinned version (`.github/workflows/build-pr.yml`), so a PR built after a newer alpha ships would apply this patch
to a different version than it was made for.

### Task 27: notation-hero/web — the patch (`pnpm patch`) and turning the feature on (F-10)

**Files (notation-hero):** `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (`minimumReleaseAgeExclude`), `web/package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`,
`patches/@coderline__alphatab@<alpha>.patch` (written by pnpm) and `patchedDependencies`,
`web/lib/alphatab/synth-with-media.ts` and its test (new), `web/app/play/PlayerShell.tsx` and its test,
`web/lib/alphatab/useAlphaTab.ts` (two api keys),
`web/app/play/TransportRow.tsx` and `web/app/play/TracksPopover.tsx` (one prop comment each),
`web/app/play/SettingsPopover.tsx` (the level rows' reasons), `web/lib/alphatab/settings-schema.ts` (two ranges, two
rows), `web/lib/alphatab/transport-storage.ts` (two bounds) and two tests that expect the old bound
(`web/lib/alphatab/transport-storage.test.ts`, and one in `web/e2e/player.e2e.ts`),
`docs/specs/2026-09-10-v0-local-file-player-design.md`
(the spec delta); for the drum tablature 1.9 draws (Step 2): `web/lib/alphatab/mixer-tracks.ts` and its test,
`client/src/components/ui/TrackRow/TrackRow.tsx` (one doc comment), `web/e2e/player.e2e.ts` (two tests) and the
changed screenshots in `web/e2e/pages.vr.ts-snapshots/`.

notation-hero is a pnpm workspace, so it uses `pnpm patch`. patch-package only writes patches next to an npm or yarn
lockfile. **F-10:** notation-hero has no external player yet: it plays a file's own recording or the synthesizer
(`PlayerMode.EnabledAutomatic`; its "External audio" playback source plays nothing), and YouTube sync is a later
milestone (its `docs/feature-freeze.md`, J-2). So this task turns mixing on for recordings and opens the controls
notation-hero greys out for a recording. The rule for an external player (keep its controls; a start inside it plays
without a count-in, F-6) goes into the notation-hero spec delta, for when J-2 is built.

- [ ] **Step 1: A branch in its own worktree; let the alpha past the release-age rule**

```bash
git fetch origin
git worktree add ../notation-hero-2397 -b feat/2397-synth-with-media origin/master
cd ../notation-hero-2397
pnpm install
```

Run these from the notation-hero checkout, and every later step in `../notation-hero-2397`, for the same reason as
Task 26 Step 1.

In `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, add `'@coderline/alphatab@<alpha>'` to `minimumReleaseAgeExclude`. Use the exact
`name@version`, like the list's other entries, and update it with every alpha upgrade. Then:

```bash
pnpm run check:supply-chain-pins
```

Expected: passes (it flags a stale pin).

- [ ] **Step 2: Upgrade and patch**

```bash
pnpm --filter web add @coderline/alphatab@<alpha>
pnpm patch @coderline/alphatab@<alpha>
```

`pnpm patch` prints a folder. Check that `<alpha>`'s `gitHead` is an ancestor of the feature branch (Task 26 Step 4),
then:

```bash
rm -r "<printed folder>/dist"
cp -R "$ALPHATAB_WORKTREE/packages/alphatab/dist" "<printed folder>/dist"
pnpm patch-commit "<printed folder>"
```

Expected: a patch file under `patches/` and a `patchedDependencies` entry.

**The drum tablature 1.9 draws** (Task 26 Step 3 is the rhythm game's side of this upgrade). 1.8.4 never drew
tablature on a drum staff; 1.9 draws it when the file asks, and the beat `/play` opens with
(`web/public/notation/1-beat.gp`) asks. The Tracks popover still marks it "Tablature: unavailable", so it can't be
hidden. Follow the rhythm game, which turned its notation toggles on for drum staves with the same alphaTab change:

- `web/lib/alphatab/mixer-tracks.ts`: `tablatureAvailable` becomes `staff.tuning.length > 0` (1.9 gives every drum
  staff a six-line tuning; piano and vocal staves still have none). Its two comments, and the `tablatureAvailable`
  doc comment in `client/src/components/ui/TrackRow/TrackRow.tsx`, stop saying it is false for percussion. In
  `mixer-tracks.test.ts`, a percussion staff with a tuning is available.
- `web/e2e/player.e2e.ts`: "tablature is enabled only on a stringed staff with a tuning" expects Punk.gp's drum rows
  to have a live Tablature toggle (off: that file doesn't ask for it). "turning off the only enabled notation type
  does not crash the player" first turns the beat's tablature off, then checks that Standard notation locks.
- Screenshots: six of the web lane's shots open that beat. Run `pnpm test:web:docker`, look at every changed shot,
  and only then run `pnpm test:web:docker:update`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Turn it on where Task 24's platform rule allows, open the controls over a recording, write the spec delta**

notation-hero has no platform helper and no external player. All new logic goes in
`web/lib/alphatab/synth-with-media.ts`, with a co-located `synth-with-media.test.ts` (the app's style, like
`playback-selection.ts`):

1. **The flag (F-10).** Add the same `supportsMixing()` as Task 26 Step 5, with the same `MIXING_ON` values (Task
   24's platform rule), and copy the fork's `isIOS()` (alphaTabWebsite `src/utils.ts`) into the file: notation-hero
   has no platform helper. Test it in `synth-with-media.test.ts`, stubbing `navigator` and `window` for each row of
   the platform rule. In `web/app/play/PlayerShell.tsx`'s `useAlphaTab` callback, next to
   `engineSettings.player.playerMode` (before the stored settings are applied), set
   `engineSettings.player.enableSynthesizerWithMedia = supportsMixing();`.
2. **The controls over a recording.** notation-hero greys out Metronome, Count-In, their two Settings rows and the
   Tracks mixer while a file plays its own recording (its v0 spec §4 and §7). With mixing on, alphaTab still builds
   its backing-track player, so they would stay greyed out while a stored metronome or count-in level clicks over the
   recording, and the button can't turn it off. Grey them out only while the recording plays alone:

   ```ts
   export function recordingPlaysAlone(
     api: AlphaTabApi | null | undefined,
     hasBackingTrack: boolean,
   ): boolean {
     const mixing = api?.settings.player.enableSynthesizerWithMedia ?? false;
     return hasBackingTrack && !mixing;
   }
   ```

   Test it: flag on, false; flag off, true; no recording, false. In `PlayerShell.tsx`, compute
   `const recordingAlone = recordingPlaysAlone(api, hasBackingTrack);` and pass it wherever the recording gates a
   control: `TransportRow`'s `hasBackingTrack` (Metronome, Count-In), `SettingsPopover`'s `mixUnavailable`
   (`recordingAlone ? RECORDING : undefined`) and `TracksPopover`'s `hasBackingTrack` (solo, mute, volume, audio
   transposition). In `TransportRow.tsx` and `TracksPopover.tsx`, the `hasBackingTrack` prop's comment becomes "plays
   an embedded recording without the synthesizer".
3. **The score's tracks over a recording: they play, and the mixer works on them** (chosen in the plan review). With
   the synthesizer along a recording, the score's tracks play (alphaTab's default), and the Tracks popover's solo,
   mute and volume, opened by item 2, choose what plays. The mix still resets per score, so each file opens with its
   tracks audible.
4. **Levels** (chosen in the plan review). In `web/lib/alphatab/settings-schema.ts`, the `player-metronome-volume`
   and `player-count-in-volume` rows go from `max: 1` to `max: 3`, alphaTab's documented range. The click sits about
   8 dB under a mastered recording (spike 5); 2.5 is about +8 dB, and with Sonivox the click alone peaks at −1.6 dBFS
   at 3. Master volume stays at `max: 1`. In `web/lib/alphatab/transport-storage.ts`, `TRANSPORT_BOUNDS` gives
   `metronomeVolume` and `countInVolume` the same `max: 3`, and its comment stops calling them 0-1 ratios: otherwise a
   stored 2.5 is clamped back to 1 on the next visit, with a "corrected" warning. Two tests store a metronome volume
   of 9 and expect the old top, 1; both now expect 3: `transport-storage.test.ts`'s "clamps a volume to the 0-1
   range its row declares" (its name drops "0-1") and `web/e2e/player.e2e.ts`'s "a single out-of-range transport
   value is corrected and the warning NAMES it" (its two comments stop saying the range is 0-1 and the top is 1).

   The transport's Metronome and Count-In buttons stay as they are: off is 0 and on is 1, so turning one off and on
   brings a raised level back to 1. A raised level is set in Settings ▸ Player.

   The score's tracks play over a recording (item 3) about 8 dB under a mastered one (the notes peak at −9.5 dBFS with
   Sonivox), and a track's own volume tops out at its channel's full level. So Settings ▸ Player gains two rows next
   to Master volume, as the rhythm game does (Task 26 Step 5):

   ```ts
   // settings-schema.ts: ApiValueKey gains 'synthVolume' | 'backingTrackVolume'
   {
     id: 'player-synth-volume',
     source: 'api',
     key: 'synthVolume',
     label: 'Synth volume (with a recording)',
     control: { kind: 'range', min: 0, max: 3, step: 0.05 },
   },
   {
     id: 'player-recording-volume',
     source: 'api',
     key: 'backingTrackVolume',
     label: 'Recording volume',
     control: { kind: 'range', min: 0, max: 1, step: 0.05 },
   },
   ```

   A row that does nothing is greyed out and says why, both from the same value (`SettingsPopover`'s existing rule).
   In `PlayerShell.tsx`, derive one reason per new row and pass both to `SettingsPopover`: Recording volume is
   unavailable without a recording ("Only for a file that plays its own recording"), and Synth volume also while the
   recording plays alone (`recordingAlone`: "The synthesizer doesn't play along recordings on this device"). In
   `web/app/play/SettingsPopover.tsx`, the row loop picks the reason by key (`metronomeVolume` and `countInVolume`:
   `mixUnavailable`; `synthVolume` and `backingTrackVolume`: the new reasons) and uses it for both `description` and
   `disabled`. The comment on the metronome row in `settings-schema.ts` stops saying they are the only two Player
   rows that disable. The two new levels are not stored: they start at 1 on every visit, and the stored transport
   values stay the four they are.

   The two rows also need wiring in the shell, or they write the wrong value: `applyApiValue` in `PlayerShell.tsx`
   sends every key it doesn't name to its `default` branch, which writes `isLooping`, and the `apiValues` memo has no
   value for either key. Moving Synth volume would set Loop (on above 0, off at 0) and leave the level as it was,
   and both rows would show 0. Add `'synthVolume' | 'backingTrackVolume'` to the `AlphaTabApiValue` union in
   `web/lib/alphatab/useAlphaTab.ts` (`setAlphaTabValue` takes only that union). In `PlayerShell.tsx`, keep both
   levels in state, starting at 1; give each a writer that calls `setAlphaTabValue` and nothing else (no
   `persistTransport`); add both to the `apiValues` memo and its dependency list; and give `applyApiValue` a case for
   each. Test it in `PlayerShell.test.tsx`: changing Synth volume writes `synthVolume` and leaves Loop off.

Then add the spec delta to `docs/specs/2026-09-10-v0-local-file-player-design.md` (notation-hero) as a dated "Spec
deltas" blockquote after the 2026-09-20 one, and mark §4's and §7's "render disabled" sentences as superseded for
this case, in that file's existing style. The delta says:

> **Spec deltas — <date> (alphaTab #2397, the synthesizer along a recording).** Where notation-hero turns alphaTab's
> `enableSynthesizerWithMedia` on (every platform except the classes alphaTab's target-device run failed), a file
> that plays its own recording also runs the synthesizer, locked to it. The metronome, the count-in, their two
> Settings rows and the Tracks mixer then work over the recording; §4's and §7's "render disabled" rule applies only
> while the recording plays alone. The score's tracks play over the recording by default; mute them in Tracks. Audio

> and the count-in plays only for starts through the app's Play button; the integration calls `updatePosition()`
> right before `api.play()` in its media-started handler (alphaTab's F-6).

- [ ] **Step 4: Check, commit, push**

Run the app's tests (`pnpm test`), its browser tests (`pnpm --filter web test:e2e`) and its screenshots
(`pnpm test:web:docker`), as its CI runs them. Then Task 26 Step 6's by-ear checks on a file with its own recording:
the metronome, a loop, a
speed change (notation-hero has no YouTube flow). Also check that over that recording, Metronome, Count-In and the
Tracks mixer are live (mute a track), that the Metronome volume row goes to 3 and keeps 2.5 after a reload, that
Synth volume lifts the score's tracks over the recording and leaves Loop off, and that a file without a recording plays as before (Synth
volume and Recording volume greyed out, with their reason).

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: metronome along backing tracks (alphaTab #2397 pnpm patch on <alpha>)"
git push -u origin feat/2397-synth-with-media
```

### Task 28: Draft the #2397 comment — never posted without the person's OK

**Files:**
- Create: `docs/spikes/issue-2397/issue-comment-draft.md`

alphaTab's AGENTS.md applies to comments too:
- the one-line disclosure with `alphatab-ai-authored-v1`;
- no proposed patches;
- no diagnosis from alphaTab's source;
- nothing fabricated.

No PR without an accepted issue. So the comment describes the need and the measured outcome, and asks whether a
contribution would be welcome.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the draft**

Use the template below and fill it with the acceptance numbers (Task 22) and the device results (Task 24):

```markdown
> _AI-assisted (`alphatab-ai-authored-v1`) — drafted with help of an AI agent._

We needed the metronome and count-in over backing tracks (and YouTube) in two apps, so we tried running the
synthesizer in sync with the media. Measured in Chromium on macOS with a generated beat track:

| | Result |
|---|---|
| Click vs beat at 1× (p95) | <S1> |
| At 1.25× / 1.5× (p95) | <S2> |
| At 0.5× / 0.75× (p95) | <S3> |
| First click after Play | <S4> |
| Loop wraps (0.5× / 1× / 1.5×) | <S10> |
| Count-in hand-off to the media | <S6> |
| iPad (WebKit) / Android (Chrome) | <device results> |

With the feature off nothing changes. Would a contribution along these lines be welcome? We can open a separate
issue describing the use case first, if that's preferred.
```

- [ ] **Step 2: STOP — ask before anything is posted**

Put to the person as `[Q-C1]`: post as drafted, edit first, or don't post. If they choose to post, they post it
themselves or explicitly ask for it to be posted. Never post on your own.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit the draft**

```bash
git add docs/spikes/issue-2397/issue-comment-draft.md
git commit -m "docs: draft #2397 comment (not posted)"
git push
```

---

## After this plan (not tasks here)

- **Upstream PR (§11 step 5, optional and later):** only after a maintainer accepts an issue for it.
  - It needs C# and Kotlin versions of the shared changes: `IAlphaSynth.backingTrackVolume` and `synthVolume` on
    their players, and `IUiFacade.createMediaSynthPlayer` returning null.
  - It needs Task 5's changes in `platform/worker/` made safe for C# and Kotlin, which build that folder:
    `AlphaSynthWebWorkerApi implements IMediaSynth` (a `@target web` interface), and the `'error'` listener typed
    with the browser's `ErrorEvent` (on `IAlphaSynthWorker` and in `_onWorkerError`), a type C# and Kotlin don't
    have. Tag them `@target web`, or give C# and Kotlin their own versions (their thread workers implement
    `IAlphaSynthWorker`).
  - It needs the alphaTab docs pages for the two settings and the two API members.
  - Drop the `docs/superpowers` and `docs/spikes` commits from the branch.
  - Add the `alphatab-ai-authored-v1` disclosure block to the PR body.
- **Later work the spec lists (§12):** a re-sync that keeps the synth's notes sounding; a direct worker → worklet
  `MessagePort`; Firefox and Safari tuning beyond the probe.
- **Spec §13's manual checks on desktop Safari and desktop Firefox:** both get mixing without a run (Task 24's
  platform rule, chosen in the plan review). Run the sync lab's Start, Loop and Count-in tests and the listening
  check in each, as in Task 24 Step 2. If one misses a §1 target or fails the listening check, put it to the person
  as D-10 does in Task 24: `MIXING_ON.other` off in both apps (the two browsers share that row) until it passes, or
  on with the miss written down.
  In Firefox, also start a YouTube song in the rhythm game with the count-in on, on a fresh load: if the video
  doesn't start after the count-in bar, keep YouTube's controls in Firefox too (`hideYouTubeControls()`).
- **Pre-calculating the first start at a new speed:** tried in spike 13
  (`docs/spikes/issue-2397/spike-13-pre-calculating-the-first-start.md`). A muted warm-up start or probing the
  coming speed doesn't move the first click at slow speeds; the media's time-stretch sets it (about +10 ms whether
  learned or not). Remembering learned values across page loads (alphaTab exposes them, the app stores them) would
  remove only the page's first re-sync (untested).
